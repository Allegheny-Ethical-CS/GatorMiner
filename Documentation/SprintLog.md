`Tasks Completed:` Kiley has built a program to store the word frequency data and category classifications of different assignments that can be used to compare different categories of assignments to find categories of words, which can be displayed under frequency analysis once there is satisfactory data. William has started working on the data mining. Kyrie has planned out how to start working on the user input and display interface. Adriana has kept a log of all of the completed tasks during the Scrum Meetings. Favour has organized the dates and times of the Scrum meetings and has delegated the necessary tasks for this Sprint.

`Tasks for Next Sprint:` We will all need to keep working on our respective tasks for the next Sprint. Kylie will continue to work on the different types of categories. William will continue to work on the data mining. Kyrie will start working on the interface, with help from Adriana. Adriana will continue to document the tasks and progress of the team throughout the Sprints. Favour will continue to schedule Scrum meetings and help out with tasks where she is needed.
