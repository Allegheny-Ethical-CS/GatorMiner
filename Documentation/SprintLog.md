# Sprint 1 Log:

`Tasks Completed:` Kiley has built a program to store the word frequency data and category classifications of different assignments that can be used to compare different categories of assignments to find categories of words, which can be displayed under frequency analysis once there is satisfactory data. William has started working on the data mining. Kyrie has planned out how to start working on the user input and display interface. Adriana has kept a log of all of the completed tasks during the Scrum Meetings. Favour has organized the dates and times of the Scrum meetings and has delegated the necessary tasks for this Sprint.

`Tasks for Next Sprint:` We will all need to keep working on our respective tasks for the next Sprint. Kiley will continue to work on the different types of categories. William will continue to work on the data mining. Kyrie will start working on the interface, with help from Adriana. Adriana will continue to document the tasks and progress of the team throughout the Sprints. Favour will continue to schedule Scrum meetings and help out with tasks where she is needed.

`Current Phase:` We are currently still in Phase 1 of the development phase.

# Sprint 2 Log:

`Tasks Completed:` Kiley finished the first part of the categories code, where our code can use user input to read where the file is and what categories the file should be split into. Kylie will work to finish the category mining for the program. Will has continued to work on data mining and will help Kylie with word category mining. Kyrie has started on the interface for the code and will work to finish the interface. Adriana has kept up with the documentation for the code, added test cases for methods in the categorize_words.py, and will work on finishing the interface with Kyrie and Kylie. Favour has continuously kept our tasks up to date and has written the explanations in our pull requests. (Command to test the test case for our code is: pipenv run pytest tests/test_categorize_words.py -s)

`Tasks for Next Sprint:` The next sprint should focus on writing more methods in the categorize_words.py file and the subsequent test cases in order to allow more coverage for the program as it will relate to GatorMiner.

`Current Phase:` We are finishing Phase 1 of the development phase.
