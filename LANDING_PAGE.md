## Welcome to GatorMiner!
GatorMiner is an automated text-mining tool written in Python to measure the technical
responsibility of students in computer science courses. It is being used to analyze
students' markdown reflection documents and five questions survey based on
Natural Language Processing in the Department of Computer Science at Allegheny
College.

### Data Retrieving

There are currently two ways to import text data for analysis: through local file system or AWS DynamoDB.

#### Local File System
What is a local file system?
  - A controlled place where data can be stored and received. In this case, this
is where GatorMiner keeps data isolated so it can be easily identified. 

In GatorMiner, you can type in the path(s) to the directories(s) that hold
reflection markdown documents. You are welcome  to try the tool with the sample
documents. You are welcome to try the tool with the sample documents we provided
in the 'resources', for example:

```shell
resources/sample_md_reflections/lab1, resources/sample_md_reflections/lab2, resources/sample_md_reflections/lab3
```
