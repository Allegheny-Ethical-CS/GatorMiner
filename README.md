# Text Mining
A text mining and analysis tool for student reflection documents and five questions
survey based on Natural language processing in the Department of Computer Science
at Allegheny College.

### Planning steps

- [ ] Make sample reflection input files for testing
- [ ] Implement frequency analysis program in Python3
  - [ ] For each reflection dociment, calculate the number of occurrences of specific keywords
  - [ ] Produce a summary of these frequencies of these words across all reflection input files
  - [ ] Generate plots of results
- [ ] Research Python3 nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) libraries


## Five Questions
- Who made the technology?
- Who are the users?
- Who is not supposed to use?
- How can the software can cause harm?
- What solutions to avoid the harm or to fix the harm?
