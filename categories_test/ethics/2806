## Ethical Benefits and Implications

The overall theme of Battlestar Galactica is that there are two
societies, one human, one robot. In this scenario, AI has evolved to the
point of being self sufficient. While this is an example of "perfect AI",
it is something many people think about when they think about AI in general.
Will it be able to be controled?

Then, hypothesizing on the issues highlighted in your generated (or modified) text, answer the following questions.

1. What future technology is featured in your synopsis?

    Self sufficient AI.

2. What are the potential social implications and/or ethical issues and/or regulatory challenges with this technology?

    There are major social implications with self sufficient AI. Is this AI
    allowed to exist? If so, does it exist within society normally, are we
    aware of what is AI and what is human? Is anyone able to regulate this
    technology?

3. What do you think might be a cautionary tale related to this technology?

    There is a point where the technology overcomes the need for any type of
    humanity and can exist completely on its own.

4. What fictional person in the future could best illustrate this caution?

5. What is their story?

6. Now, consider what a `Light Mirror` scenario would be for this story. That is, what benefit can come out of the  technology featured in the story and how can we work towards preventing the negative consequences of the future they envision?

    While we have discussed the very real challenges to ethical AI, I'd say
    self - sufficient AI, if ethical, could be used positively in many ways.
    However this all still depends on what we as a society can agree on as
    "ethical".
