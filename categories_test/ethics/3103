###Summary and Outcome of race:
After reading the article we can say that robots can be ethical but to a certain
degree. If robots are designed incorrectly than they can pose a threat to everyone
around them. People can use them for exploitation or even worse harm. In the article
the author discusses how even creating ethical robots in the first place could
be unethical. Ethical robots can be a good improvement for society but they have
to be designed in a way that allows them to only perform the tasks that they
were intended to do. In the long run, it depends on the public's opinion if a specific
robot is ethical or not. After looking at the races, we noticed that one of the aggressive
behaviors was in the pushing race. The robot backed up after pushing the box and started going
back forth hitting the box over and over again. One ethical behavior we saw was how the
robots reached the finish line at a really fast rate.
