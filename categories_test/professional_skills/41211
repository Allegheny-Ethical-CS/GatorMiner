## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern about team-based software engineering is trying to figure out the best time we can meet together and work because of everyone's schedules. My team have had some difficulty with that but we have been able to work past that thankfully and it has not put a wrinkle in any of our future plans. However, right now, that remains my biggest concern compared to everything else.
