Teamwork

Building software systems is generally a solitary endeavor, but a software engineer must still be able to communicate regularly with other people and teams. As an engineer, you should be able to articulate project needs, as well as be able to discuss any challenges or problems that arise. Software engineers will routinely work with a number of other teams and departments at once, while also managing a team of their own.

You may be required to work with people whose ideas and philosophies you don’t agree with. Other times, misunderstandings arise and can threaten you and your team’s deadline. A successful engineer should be comfortable working closely with others, compromising and innovating as needed.
