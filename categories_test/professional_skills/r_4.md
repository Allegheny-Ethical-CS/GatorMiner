4. Professionalism

Some tech companies are famous for their informal vibes, but no matter what you know about the place you are applying for—show the utmost professionalism. This can apply to how you dress, how you carry yourself and how you talk about your experiences.

“Refrain from using words like ‘exceptional’ about yourself unless you can prove that you are far above the curve,” Vancil advises, urging job hunters in technology to also clean up their social media. Consider how you want to be seen by employers and make sure your presence—in person and online—is professional. As appealing as it might be to thumb your nose at convention, take the time to self-evaluate your demeanor and online presence through the eyes of a stranger and ask yourself, “Would I trust this person with important work?”
