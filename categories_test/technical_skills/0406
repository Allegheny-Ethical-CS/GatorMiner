## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

One thing I am valued the most about the assignment is that I learned how to make a change in a stored data. Even though I was coding and adding the changes, it felt like somebody else is changing it. It was similar to creating an Artificial Intelligence my own. It was a great experience to see that I can actually code and do something that works in Java. I am so glad learning the capacity of computer science and what it can accomplish with these odd codes.
