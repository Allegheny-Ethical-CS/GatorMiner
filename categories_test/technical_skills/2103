## Text Analysis

For text analysis I decided to do POS tagging. For that I used `nltk` library.
First I tokenized the generated text using `word_tokenize()` function. Then
`pos_tag()` function tags the tokens and returns as a list of tuple, with
token and respective POS. After that I decided to better visualize the
output color the tokens depending on their POS. For example nouns would be
colored cyan, verbs green and adjectives red, I left all the rest unchanged.
For coloring the output I used
ANSI escape codes([link](https://ozzmaker.com/add-colour-to-text-in-python/)).
Each color has its code, for example red: `31`, cyan: `36`, green: `32`. The
colors are given at the time of printing out.
