## Text Analysis

Describe the techniques used for an automated text analysis of your automated script synopsis. Cite (provide a link to) any sources you have used. Include a graph or textual output of your analysis.

The default pipeline provided by the Stanford NLP package was employed. This package tokenizes a sentence and analyzes both words and word fragments based upon their function within the sentence, their governing word, and relationship to the dependent word.
