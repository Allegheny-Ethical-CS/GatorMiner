## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
Coming up with the strategy that avoid the problem generating when converting A to T, T to A or C to G, G to C.
If the converting command order is wrong, then the actual DNA sequence will be in a disorder. Then my soulution is
make the origianl DNA sequence order into lower case and then during the converting process, directly convcrt the
lower case to upper case, so all the four convering command line will not interference each other. It is a little
bit frustrating when the checkstyle thing does not allow the name of sting or data in the format of dna_origianl
while the input file is written as dna_input. I thought naming in this way will make it much clearer about the
actual meaning of different variables.and which number represents which position also confuesd me for a while.
