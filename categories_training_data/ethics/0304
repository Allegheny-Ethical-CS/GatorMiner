## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?

The genome editing technology is created by computer scientists, along with the
help of bioethicists, as well as other biologists.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?

The users of genome editing technology are scientists that are trying to change
the DNA of an embryo that has potential of having various diseases that both parents
could pass on.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?

The every day common person should not use genome editing technology.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?

The genome editing technology can cause harm by messing up the original genome in a way that can't be fixed that could be detrimental by whoever/whatever is being operated on by either making edits in the wrong place, or making it so only some of the cells have it.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?

The first solution is to make sure that genome manipulation is almost completely safe before any sort of clinical trials are put into action. Obviously there is no way it can ever be 100% safe because almost all medical procedures have a little bit of risk involved, but to make it so it is almost always safe would be the best bet. Another way to avoid harm is to inform whoever is having the genome manipulation done what the risks are, and what the outcome should be.
