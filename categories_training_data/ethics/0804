## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
After reading the article, it seems like that genome editing technology was introduced
by the enhanced genome editing technology called CRISPR which many believes has the potential
to make such editing more accurate and even "easy" in comparison to older technologies.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Many scientists and bioethicists are the users of this genome editing technology
because they believe that those using for gene therapy are very ethical

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Scientists and also bioethicists acknowledge that in some cases, germline editing can address needs
not met by PGD (Preimplantation genetic diagnosis). This includes when both parents are homozygous for a disease-causing variant
(they both have two copies of the variant, so all of their children would be affected by the disease)
 and for families who object to some elements of the PGD process.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
Some researchers and bioethicists are  very concerned that any use of  genome editing, even for
the obvious therapeutic uses, will start the world on a constant need of  using it for non-therapeutic
and enhancement purposes, which can be viewed to many people as controversial.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
In this article, it states how many bioethical and research groups believe that research using gene editing in embryos
is important for several reasons, including to address unanswered scientific questions about human biology, as long
as it is not used for reproductive purposes at this time, which was emphasized throughout the article a tactic
that should be avoided.
