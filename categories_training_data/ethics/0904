## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
National Human Genome Research Institute created CRISPER but they cannot take federal funds for research because the research creates/destroys embryos.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Currently the only approved area of research is gene therapy for people who need help treating disease by altering the patient's genetic material. It is not yet approved for reproductive health. Additionally, genome therapy is expensive and not covered by insurance because of it’s experimental nature so only people of a certain wealth can afford it.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Reproductive health is not supposed to have genome research done on it yet because the long term effects and all the consequences have not been ruled out so people cannot give complete informed consent.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
It can have off target effect and one error can be catastrophic effects especially when done on human. Also something I’ve learned about in a different class is the eugenics movement and this could contribute to this movement of attempting breed a healthier, “better” society.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
I think what researchers are doing now is good at not causing harm. Doing full research and not releasing such substantial treatment to humans before figuring out all side effects.
