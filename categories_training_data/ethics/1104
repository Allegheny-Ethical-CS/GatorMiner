## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
  The people who make genome editing technology can be software engineers who focus on making biological related programs and tools, or people who majored in Bioinformatics.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
  The people most likely to use genome editing technologies like this are scientists or researchers that are doing research or experimentation on DNA sequences.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
  People who would like to use this to bring harm to others. These may be people like terrorists trying to use the tool to spread chemical warfare that can harm the innocent.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
  People can use the genome editing tool to create biochemicals that are lethal. They can edit and manipulate DNA at their own will so the possibilities are endless, but one example can be that they can make a certain chemical that can target people with certain genotypes as they have specified.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
  We can try to manage who uses the powerful tools that can create the biomolecules that are designed by such programs. So even if people do design the harmful agents, they do not have a way of making them, because it will be almost impossible to control the programs themselves from being made, since anyone with the knowledge can make them. Another way can be to spread awareness and teach people about being responsible with technology. Technology has become a very integral part of life and is advancing at an incredible rate, so people should know how to use it properly and responsibly.
