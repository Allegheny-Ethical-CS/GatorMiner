## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
American scientist Jennifer Doudna makes the genome editing technology.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Scientist are the user for the genome editing technology.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Non scientist not supposed to use the genome editing technology.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
The technique can cause big deletions or rearrangements of DNA.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
Base editors that alter specific DNA letters and nickases that do not completely sever the DNA. In addition using modified forms of CRISPR to control how active a gene is instead of directly altering a geneâ€™s DNA.
