## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
Many world leaders such as the US, UK, and China. Scientist design CRISPR to target
specific genes for editing.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Currently, researches are the users of genome editing technology. They are trying
to find a safe, ethical, and effective way to edit genes.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Currently, it is not supposed to be used for clinical reproductive purposes. Research
that creates or destroys embryos can not be funded federally.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
There can be an off-target effect and mosaicism that cause harm, because the genes
were not edited correctly. As well, there is concern this could divide people, as
the wealthy could afford to have genes edited and the possibility of enhanced genes.
Also, there is the question of consent for germline therapy.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
More research can be done to make CRISPR safer in the aspect that it does not have
an off-target effect. A solution for it only being accessible to the wealthy could
be finding a way to make it cheaper or having insurance or programs cover the costs.
