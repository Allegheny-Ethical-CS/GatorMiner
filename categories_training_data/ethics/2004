## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
The people that make the genome editing technology are referred to as researchers and bioethicists.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Scientists and research groups that work together in order to edit the DNA to how they want it.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
People that are not supposed to use the genome editing technology are normal citizens and people that do not have legal access or are not certified to use the science.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
The genome editing can cause major harm because if some cells do not receive the same edit as the other cells, then the cells will obviously not be the same and there will be a distortion in the DNA and ultimately the human.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
One solution is to just keep studying and testing the genome editing functions. This genome editing science needs to be full-proof in order to start using it in everyday life so one way to work out the kinks is to just practice using it.
