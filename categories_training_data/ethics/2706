## Ethical Benefits and Implications
Some of the themes related to this technology would be a never-ending powersource, irony, and improper working conditions.

Then, hypothesizing on the issues highlighted in your generated (or modified) text, answer the following questions.

1. What future technology is featured in your synopsis?
-A battery that never runs out of charge because another universe is inside the battery and the society that exists generates power for the battery, so in theory the battery should never run out. This could fix the world's energy problem and make the world carbon neutral

2. What are the potential social implications and/or ethical issues and/or regulatory challenges with this technology?
-The big issue with this technology is that the society in the battery has no idea that they are just being used for their manpower. The characters in the episode actually touch on this idea and Morty actually calls it slavery.

3. What do you think might be a cautionary tale related to this technology?
-In the episode the civilization in the battery figures out the same way to generate power, and the civilization they create does the same thing. This cycle could keep happening and none of these societies have any idea they are just basically working for free for the civilization that created them.

4. What fictional person in the future could best illustrate this caution?
-This issue is touched of twice in the episode, once by one of the main characters, Morty and then by Rick once they go to the second created universe.

5. What is their story?
-When the main characters battery dies they must go into the battery to find out why. Morty is naive to how the battery works and once Rick tells him he calls it "slavery with extra steps". Once in the made up universe Rick and Morty see the scientist who had the same idea as Rick and they then go it that universe where Rick then says the same thing to the scientist that Morty said to him. Rick of course just wants the battery to function and with the new created universe they do not get any energy so he wants them to get rid of the universe.

6. Now, consider what a ``Light Mirror`` scenario would be for this story. That is, what benefit can come out of the  technology featured in the story and how can we work towards preventing the negative consequences of the future they envision?"
-The only way that I can really see preventing the negative consequences of this technology is by making sure the people in the created universe know their purpose and that get some sort of compensation for the work.
