## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

A learning experience that I valued the most after completing this assignment is that a lot of trial and error goes into making sure everything is running correctly. I rewrote the commands and played with different variables so many times that it was frustrating, but a valuable takeaway experience.
