## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
  The greatest challenge I faced when when doing this lab was to actually get the program working. I spent a lot of time trying to fix things that were hindering my program from working and I still couldn't get it to work. It seemed no matter what I tried the program just refused to run or build. I have been trying to overcome by looking through the past programs, and lecture notes from class.
