## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
The task i want to practice more is the using the replacing command. The problem with my program is that it's not wanting to replace the certain letter of the DNA code with another letter for a reason I could not decipher, and I tried to do it all on my own instead of going to a technical leaders office hours and getting help. I will know not to make that mistake, so asking for help is another task that I want to practice more.
