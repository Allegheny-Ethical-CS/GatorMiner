## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I learned how important patience and really reading the objective of an assignment is. Usually when I
am given an assignment, I jump right without really processing the reading material and that is what I did for this lab.
I can now realize the drastic mistake I made doing this. Without reading the material, I stood very confused and
very flustered that I could not figure out the lab and get the right input. I valued this learning experience
because it helped me realize how I was originally working on assignments was not correct.
