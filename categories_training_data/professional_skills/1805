## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I wish to practice problem solving more in the sense of computational thinking. My educational background does not involve computational thinking and this is a new skill for me. Therefore, I wish to practice coding more and learning more methods so I can apply my problem solving skills. I feel that any practice that I have more of will benefit me in the long run.
