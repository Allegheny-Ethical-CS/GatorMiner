## Challenges and Learning Experiences
<!-- Discuss any challenges you have encountered during the work on this lab and  describe what have you learned. -->
Our biggest challenge was understanding the code we were using and knowing how
to properly run a sentiment analysis on it. Initially when we saw the code from
the given websites (on the assignment sheet), we were unsure of how it was actually
working. We knew we need to find a file of subscripts but how it was suppose to
work, we were unsure. After reading through and breaking up the code line by line,
we were able to understand what was happening. We then went and added our own
process of sentiment analysis. The only problem with this was that it was on the
whole text file/dialogue rather than our generated text. It seemed easy to transfer
our thought process but in reality, it gave us some problems. We struggled with it
actually being able to grab the code and read it from the command line interface.
Consequently, after some research we found that we were able to generate straight
into a file. WE then just needed to open that file, which allowed for the sentiment
analysis to occur on the generated data. From our first issue with our analyzer,
we learned that if you take the time and break apart the code found, it can be useful
and you can add valuable functions. Our second challenge, allowed us to learn how
to run an analysis on generated text that was within our command line interface.
