## Challenges and Learning Experiences

The synopsis we created was minimum, and the program would need more training data to create a better synopsis. While I can understand the dialogue, it isn't fully coherent. This may be due to that particular episode we chose as well.
During this lab one of the clear challenges was our communication during this lab session. We are very close friends so it was easy to ask hey when do you want to work on this and so on. But it was very difficult to communicate since we were not sitting next to each other it was hard to make sure we were working on separate things and weren't just doing the same thing and repeating it. With communication being an issue another issue we had was working around the hectic time we are currently in. With all the breaks and extensions it was difficult to keep track of everything that was going on and when deadlines were due and making sure we did our work on time.
