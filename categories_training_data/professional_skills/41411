## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern about team-based software engineering is all of the technical issues that can arise with many different systems attempting to work on the same software. I have been the only person on my team able to install GatorMiner so far and a lot of people also haven't been able to edit the Zenhub board. I am concerned about the possibility of these major technical issues persisting and making communication and collaboration even harder, especially being the remote format that we are in.
