## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern about team-based software engineering is the fact that it is a team based activity. There are a lot of moving parts in it, as there are multiple groups working on the project as well as multiple team members in those groups. So organizing all these individual parts to make a successful project would be difficult in my opinion.
