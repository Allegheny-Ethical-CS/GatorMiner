* Communication

* :flushed: = Student does not interact with others, and neglects group members.
* :worried: = Student responds to group members with great delay, and lacks contributions.
* :neutral_face: = Student interacts with the group moderately and is in proper communication.
* :blush: = Student helps other group members and interacts frequently with the group.
* :laughing: = Student leads the group discussions and helps other students.

I believe that I am at :laughing: for this section because I have been actively communicating with my group and helping them to resolve various challenges. I took the lead finding and delegating roles within the group, and have helped my team members resolve issues with Github as well as outlining for the group how we will develop our main deliverable.
