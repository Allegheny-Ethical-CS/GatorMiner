Multitasking

As a software engineer, you will be required to manage multiple projects in a deadline-driven environment. Whether you work remotely as a freelancer or as a full-time employee in an office, you’ll need to manage multiple projects at once, each with their own urgent timeline. A successful software engineer will be able to prioritize, triage, and manage all of the various milestones of all the various projects on their plate at a given time.

Along with managing timelines, a software engineer will need to be able to thrive in an environment where deadlines occur regularly. You’ll have to manage other people’s priorities and balance them with your own, along with the needs of your other clients or projects.
