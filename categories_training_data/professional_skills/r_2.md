2. Writing and presenting

If you are an excellent conversationalist, you might still want to brush up on some of the more formal modes of communication. “I’d advise Computer Science students to also work on soft skills like writing and speaking,” says Mike Soylu, co-founder of Pisano. Many positions involve a responsibility to explain your work to people who don’t understand the technical side of it.

Maybe you will give a presentation to board members or stakeholders who are funding your project. Maybe you will work with marketers or project managers who need to understand what your process will be. Whatever the specifics look like, being able to effectively communicate and explain your work is a huge plus. Try challenging yourself by taking a step back from your work and describing what you’re working on to audiences of different technical abilities—if you can explain it simply, it’s a sign of mastery.

Soylu recommends finding ways to practice these skills as soon as possible. “Take part in university clubs, write a blog, take extra courses that involve giving presentations. Any candidate who can communicate clearly and show these skills will definitely attract the attention of recruiters.”
