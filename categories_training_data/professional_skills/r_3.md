3. Self-awareness

“I really appreciate a candidate when they have a good sense of self-awareness,” Carlson says. “They know what they're good at and where they need improvement.” Pairing that with a desire to learn is perfect for anyone in technology. If you don’t know where you are lacking, how can you grow? “The most interesting resumes, to me, are those that are asking for opportunities to learn,” Vancil says.

You don’t have to pretend to be the absolutely perfect, all-knowing candidate—and attempting to do so may be worse than giving an honest assessment. If you’re interviewing and not sure how to answer a hypothetical problem, acknowledge it and explain the steps you’d take to figure it out.

“I'm more than willing to give someone a chance even if they're not a perfect fit with the skills ‘wish list,’” Carlson adds.
