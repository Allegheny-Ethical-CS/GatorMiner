## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

The greatest technical challenge that I faced was getting the program to run and build successfully. This lab was very difficult in matching up variables and inserting and deleting a random letter. It was not clear how to go about this and I think I was making it more complicated than it needed to be. It was also challenging to get the variables to match up in terms of String, int, and char in order for the program to build successfully. Overall it was difficult performing the three mutations and writing the correct commands to get the desired output.
