## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?

One task that I would like to practice more after completing this assignment is using the random class commands and using letters in random commands rather than numbers. I think choosing a random number somewhat makes sense, but assigning random positions and then random letters is a little more difficult and a type of command I would like to practice more.
