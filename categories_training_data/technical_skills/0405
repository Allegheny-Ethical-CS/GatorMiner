## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?

After completing the assignment, I felt that we could make a change in everything we want to. It is not only in DNA, but also we can change rules or make changes between words in a statement. I would like to practice in a game that has rules in it. I can change whole game rules or specific words that came after they won or lost the game. It would be interesting to work on it. Additionally, if I want to change the data in the game that how much I scored or other people scored. I believe it would be different to make a change to data that is already stored. I can make the game so different than usual. It is one way to be an expert on data scientist and software engineer. In my opinion, it also could help students to be more interactive in the classroom and be helpful to practice what they have learned in class.
