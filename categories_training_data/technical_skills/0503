## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

 the greatest technical challenge that I faced during this was figuring out the
 next step. Many times during this lab I would over thinking what I needed to do and
 end up making an extra couple steps which would end up back firing when I tried to run
 my program. I think I also struggled with making sure that my code's output was acutely
 did the action that I was trying to input, it was easier to make sure may coding worked
 but I had to double check that it actually was being affective.
