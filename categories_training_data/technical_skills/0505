## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
  After completing this assignment I would like to study the commands that we use.
  I think I need to study how the formatting and knowing what needs to be capitalized
  verses lower case.  I would also like to practice and continue to learn the command
  line code for terminal. In addition, memorizing more of java code so I can go
  about projects a little more efficiently. I would like to practice these tasks
  so that when I am completing projects I can do it without having to restart or
  do multiple things over again. I think a lot things have improved but I would still
  like for it to become habit so that I stop making silly mistakes. To answer the
  question of why basically just revolves around wanting to get a better and more efficient
  understanding of computer science
