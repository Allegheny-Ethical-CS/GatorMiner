## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
Overall this was, in my opinion, one of the more challenging labs and it took some time to get through so that it would build and run smoothly. One of the main struggles that I faced was the construction the code which was responsible for the randomization and construction of integers. During classes this was a similar issue and I sought to find a way to better understand it. First I attempted to solves this problem with my own knowledge. I followed by looking over all notes, slides, and looking at sections of the textbook that would help me find a solution. Once this failed, I sought to find a teacher's assistant with a better understanding. With their help, I was able to understand the errors I was making and correct them so that my program could run smoothly.
