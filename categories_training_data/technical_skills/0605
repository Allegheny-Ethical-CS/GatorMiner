## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
After taking the time to complete the lab through a trial and error process, I felt there were a couple of tasks that definitely required some refining. One being I had difficulty with the construction of randomizing integers. After a couple attempts to complete the process on my own, I acquired some assistance. I got into contact with a teacher's assistant who helped me figure out the mistakes that I was making and explained the ways which I would be able to improve. Only then was I able to accurately accomplish this section on the lab. I would most certainly require and desire further practice with integers and randomizing in general. This way I will be a lot more confident and be able to do these tasks with little difficulty.
