## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

I've said this many times that one of the greatest technical challenges as a new learner is trying to think about the newly introduced logical methods while also being responsible for executing them in the proper syntax. However, I noticed that this time around it took less time for me to figure out the various steps of the program when I practiced the strategy of writing in pseudocode and then reworking the ideas in the correct code language by looking at outside references. I once again did not have a team for this lab, though I thought it was meant to be independent and was definitely not as difficult as lab 4. The next challenge which had to be faced was how to pull a random letter between ATCG and use those in the first step of finding the complement. I ended up coming up with the strategy of taking 2 more new temporary letters as place holders and then including them in the final steps as swap commands to ensure that the other swapping systems would not undo themselves.
