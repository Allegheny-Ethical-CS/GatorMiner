## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
I honestly can say the whole lab was a technical challenge for me mainly because of the complexity of the lab and
also there was a lot of work to be done. There was three different methods that needed to be done with the DNA string.
I realized that many of the different codes and functions in class would apply to this lab such as the charAt() function,
which we used to return certain characters in a certain string. The replace() method was also utilized so we could replace
certain characters to fit the requirements of the assignment.
