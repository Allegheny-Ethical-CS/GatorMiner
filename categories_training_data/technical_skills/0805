## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I can see that I am not perfect with using the methods replace and length and I would love to see how
I can become better at those. It was challenging for me to understand what was really going on when
I utilized those methods and after much time and seeing what the output of the code was, I finally
started to understand what was truly going on. Besides that, I find using those methods very interesting
because you can easily manipulate a sentence with those methods and easily turn it into what you want.
It fascinates me a lot so I would love to practice more with the methods so I can better understand it
and utilize it in more programs in the future.
