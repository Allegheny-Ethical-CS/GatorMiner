## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
After this, I would like to practice the random class more, as it is the newest and still most confusing to me, as well as review the basics of string and substring methods within java coding. Other than that, I just need to calm down and make sure I review all my keystrokes and symbols to identify where I may be violating checkstyle rules.
