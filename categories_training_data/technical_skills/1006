## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I valued learning how to program randomization and replacement methods, but also the ethics and debate surrounding gene editing as a whole. I feel much more capable of weighing in on genome editing in social and political conversations, and have a deeper appreciation for what the software we develop is truly capable of when applies in the right context.
