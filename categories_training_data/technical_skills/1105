## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?

The task I want to work on the most is being able to fully understand the different functions and codes we learn in class so that I can implement them in new and different situations. When I was trying to insert and delete characters into the DNA string, I was completely lost on how to do it. But I already learned what to use to accomplish the task, I just did not know how to do it. So I want to work on that the most so it does not take me as much time or effort to do this next time. I also want to work on being able to memorize and internalize the different codes that we learned. While doing this assignment, I found my self going back to my old labs to read some of the command line because I forgot how to use them. I feel like this is highly inefficient, so I would like to stop this habit and be able to write the basic codes without needing such assistance.
