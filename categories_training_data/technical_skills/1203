## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
The greatest technical challenge I faced while working on this lab was figuring out how to use substring
and learning how to insert things into strings. I worked on my own to get a better understanding of substring and
what I had to use it successfully. For example, in this lab, I was able to figure out how to insert a random character
at a random position. Additionally, I don't believe gatorgrader is taking the question below into consideration for the word count.
