## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
the learning experience that i value the most is probably the TODO of compute the  complement of the DNA String i valued this because i did it by myself and i think it shows that i am starting to learn and remember how to do some parts of the coding we use. i also think that it gives me confidence that i will be able to use all the codes we use and memorize and use them correctly. each Lab and practicals we do i think i get closer and closer to using  all of our codes correctly.
