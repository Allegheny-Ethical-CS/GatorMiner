## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
The greatest technical challenge that I faced during this lab was figuring out the different ways to manipulate the DNA. I was able to figure out, for the most part, how to do the first part where we had to come up with the complement of the DNA String. When it came to adding and making a character disappear it was a little tougher to understand the correct format that we were supposed to use. In order to overcome this challenge, I asked for help from the technical assistants in order to understand the process of how to solve these problems. They were able to give me examples so that I could understand how to make the code work which was helpful because it allowed me to see what I had to do rather than just skipping to the answer.
