## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
One thing that I would like to practice more is how to use the codes in the correct way. I can usually get them started and understand what I'm doing, but when I have to put them together is when I get confused the most. I would like to practice this more because it'd be beneficial when I was doing a lab so that I wouldn't get as confused and rely on the TA's help as much as I feel like I have been.
