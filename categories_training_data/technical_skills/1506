## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
The one thing I have learned is what it means with replace statements. I understand that when it says replace, the first letter is what is being replaced and the second letter is what will be in the spot of the previous letter. I have valued that piece learning because I am not too bad at doing those and understand the principle of what is going on in the program. I am encouraged that i am making progress in that aspect because a couple weeks ago i would have had no clue what that was meant to do.
