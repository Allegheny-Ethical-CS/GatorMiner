## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: takes the next integer until the first white space
- `charAt`: takes a character at a given location as an object
- `substring`: takes a section of a string at given character locations
- 'length' : counts how many characters are in a string
- 'replace' : for every given character a new character supplants it
