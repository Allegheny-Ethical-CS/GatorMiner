## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I value the experience of learning new coding methods. This lab was a challenge for me so I was forced to improve my skills and learn to code more efficiently. I am happy that I learned the replace method, such as when I replaced a letter with another random letter, <.replaceFirst>.
