## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
The greatest difficulty I experienced was organizing the commands to insert, delete,
and substitute nucleotides into the sequence. This trouble came from determining
what commands to use and how to use them. To overcome this, I did a general search
of the web for how it can be done. This helped me organize the order of my commands
and what commands to use. Also, it took a lot of trial and error to get everything
correct so it would give me the correct output. Another challenge I had was with
spacing. I kept having build errors that had something to do with spacing and going
past so many characters on a single line. Again, this was just trial and error to
overcome, along with looking at what lines were causing the build error.
