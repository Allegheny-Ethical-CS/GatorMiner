## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I would like to review commands. I am still having trouble remembering commands
not used super often. I have trouble remembering how they are used and exactly what
they do. I would also like to explore more ways commands could be used. The reason
I would like to practice this more is because this has been giving me difficulty
over most the labs. Also, I would like to understand the spacing used in code. Why
do you have to tab some commands in but not other commands. I believe it means it
is a part of the previous command when tabbed in past it, but I would like to know
for sure.
