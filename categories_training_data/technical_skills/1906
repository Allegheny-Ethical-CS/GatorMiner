## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I enjoyed how this can apply to other fields of science like biology. I am a biochemistry
major, so I liked seeing how a program can simulate changes to DNA sequences and
tell you what the mutation was and where the mutation was. I think programs like
this could/are useful for other fields of science. Also, I enjoyed the article.
It is on the subject I am doing my senior research on.
