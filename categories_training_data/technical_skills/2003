## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

The greatest technical challenge that I faced was figuring out how to actually write a piece of code that would work. This may sound dumb, but the hardest part of this lab assignment for me at least, was to look what was wrong with each part of the code I was typing and fix the issue. In my opinion, this was the toughest and most complicated lab we have done in this class thus far. This lab assignment took into account a bunch of different skills that we have learned in the recent weeks. We had to use the random class along with the for loops and scanner methods. These are all things that we learned in class and through practicals, but we just have not gotten a lot of time to work on these skills. While we have not mastered these various skills in this class yet, practicing like this in a lab assignment is the only way that we are going to learn it and hopefully get better overall as a programmer. Yes, my challenge is very broad and an overarching theme but I just feel like I need to better my computer science skills so that it is easier to know when and where to use a certain method or technique. I simply conquered these challenges by referring back to the practicals and class documents that we reviewed in class. These helped me by providing an example and being a resource sop that I could mirror the same technique in my source code.
