## Text Analysis
<!-- Describe the techniques used for an automated text analysis of your automated script synopsis. Cite (provide a link to) any sources you have used. Include a graph or textual output of your analysis. -->

We use SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to analyze the NCIS dialog in order to get a negative
or positive emotion. We included a for loop with a nested if-else that measures the
polarity list and prints out a sentence of whether it is positive or negative and
also prints the polarity number. The sentiment is on a scale from -1 to 1 and thus,
any value below zero results in a negative polarity and any value above zero is
a positive polarity. We have this sentiment analyzing the text that is generated
from our `generator.py` file. We have it read through that file and measure
the sentiment polarity. It reads through the file by opening the the text file,
splitting it into strings, and measuring the polarity and saving it into a list.
Along with our sentiment analysis, our generator outputs a temperature with each
paragraph it displays. These temperature range from 0 to 1. The higher the temperature
the more positive the paragraph will be. By doing both analyzers, we are able to
get a cohesive sentiment on the paragraph as a whole and then individual ones for
each separate group. To see the textual output that is analyzed, go to `generated_text.txt`.
The sentiment that was produced when we ran it was
