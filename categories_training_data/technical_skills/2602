## Text Generation

Describe the techniques used for an automated generation of your script synopsis. Cite (provide a link to) any sources you have used. Include your generated text (or its snippet) below.

The default configuration using textgenrnn was employed. With the subtitles being provided in very short fragments, a total of 50 epochs were used in order to generate moderately cohesive dialogue that retains the stylistic properties of the source material. In terms of the input material, a file containing the collation of dialogue from every episode (without foreign and non-Unicode symbols) was used. As per the default configuration, snippets as concise as the original input lines were displayed at various different "temperatures" in order to cover a diverse range of possible generated snippets.
