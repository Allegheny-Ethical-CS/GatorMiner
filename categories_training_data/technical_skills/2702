## Text Generation
To generate text I first had to get the text from the saved file and read it into a string. After this every character in the file was sorted and given a number. After this the model then learned the sequences of the numbers and tried to predict the next words. Now all of the training has been completed I ran my model for 300 EPOCHS. While this may seem like a lot each EPOCH only look seconds to run and the more times through the data the better. Finally the predicted text appeared once the model is done. I modeled my program after the step by step instructions found on https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation
