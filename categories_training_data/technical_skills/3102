###Aggressive behavior for robot:
When we were first designing our robot, we really were not sure what kind of
aggressive behavior we could add. After testing our programs for the first few times
we started to get some ideas. For our robot specifically, we decided to make our
robot do an aggressive behavior in the sprinting race. When our robot is done racing,
it will spin and do a 360. To us this was an aggressive behavior because the goal
of the sprint race is to just go in a straight line as fast as possible. Nothing else
is suppose to happen after that. All robots are designed to perform and complete a certain task.
When something random happens that wasn't accounted for, the behavior of the machine
or robot will certainly change. The change may be very small, but it could be the
cause to a bigger problem.
