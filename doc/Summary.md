What the summary analyzer is essentially what the name implies, it gives a sort of summary of all the assignments in the folder. How it functions is that it takes the first line for the prompt that it is given, such as what was the greatest challenge you encountered and it takes the responses and puts them into lines based on the individual's response. You can then see what the summary is from each person and how they responded to the prompt or if they responded to the prompt at all.
