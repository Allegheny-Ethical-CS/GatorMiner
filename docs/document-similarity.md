Document Similarity is a method to determine the similarity between certain sentences,
paragraphs, and documents.
It is widely used in identifying plagiarisms.
It means that the program converts a document into a collection of strings and vectors.
Similar words or sentences will be marked as a vector and compared to the other document.
With this, we can calculate the angle between the document vectors.
The vector angle should be from 0-90 which demonstrates how similar they are.
If the vector angle is close to 0, it is really similar.
If the vector angle is close to 90, documents are completely different.
For user convenience, we can assign different colors to each end, 0-90.
We can identify the similarity from the color shades.
