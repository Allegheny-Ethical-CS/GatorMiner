# Frequency Analysis

Frequency analysis is the quantification and analysis of word usage in text (how often a word appears within a certain text). Overall, frequency analysis can provide amazing insight into the many aspects of assignments that instructors may not always be able to observe. There is a lot of value in making this information available in a user-friendly and intuitive fashion. This can be achieved using GatorMiner frequency analysis.

Within the GatorMiner tool, you have the ability to choose `Frequency Analysis` as an analysis option after the path to the desired reflection documents is submitted.

When the tool runs a frequency analysis, on any number of assignments, it provides 3 different options to choose from:

- Overall
- Student
- Question

When `Overall` is selected, the application will display a vertical bar chart containing a list of the words used with the highest frequency for each given assignment.

When `Student` is selected, a dropdown menu is provided allowing you to pick which student the tool should display frequency data for.

As with `Overall`, this data is also displayed as a vertical bar chart and you can display multiple students' data on the same page in order to compare and contrast the types of words that are being used by students.
