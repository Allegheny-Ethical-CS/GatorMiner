# Frequency Analysis

## What is it?

Frequency analysis is the quantification and analysis of word usage in text (how often a word appears within a certain text). Overall, frequency analysis can provide amazing insight into the many aspects of assignments that instructors may not always be able to observe. There is a lot of value in making this information available in a user-friendly and intuitive fashion. This can be achieved using GatorMiner frequency analysis.

Within the GatorMiner tool, you have the ability to choose `Frequency Analysis` as an analysis option after the path to the desired reflection documents is submitted.

## How to use it?

When the tool runs a frequency analysis it provides 3 different options to choose from in the left sidebar:

- Overall
- Student
- Question

When `Overall` is selected, the application will display a vertical bar chart containing a list of the words used with the highest frequency for each given assignment.

When `Student` is selected, a dropdown menu is provided allowing you to pick which student the tool should display frequency data for.

As with `Overall`, this data is also displayed as a vertical bar chart and you can display multiple students' data on the same page in order to compare and contrast the types of words that are being used by students.

Also in the left sidebar there is the option to change the number of most frequent words to be calculated. You can choose anywhere from the most used word to the 20 most used words. You can also choose any where from 1 to 5 bar charts to be displayed.
