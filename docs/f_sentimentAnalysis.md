# Sentiment Analysis

# What is it?

Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Overall,
this is a technique to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral.

A sentiment score is calculated resulting in a value between -1 and 1. A value that is close to -1 corresponds to a strong negative sentiment in the document. Similarly a value that is close to a 1 corresponds to a strong positive sentiment. The closer the value is to 0, the more neutral the sentiment is.

Within the GatorMiner tool, you have the ability to choose `Sentiment Analysis` as an analysis option after the path to the desired reflection documents is submitted.

# How to use it?

When the tool runs a frequency analysis it provides 3 different options to choose from in the left sidebar:

- Overall
- Student
- Question

When `Overall` is selected, a scatter plot and a bar chart appear on the screen displaying the overall sentiment polarity in, for example, assignment-01 given by the users.

When `Student` is selected, it allows the user to choose a specific student to observe. When chosen it shows the sentiment shown by the chosen user with a mini bar graph and a bigger version of that using a histogram. Inside this feature, you can also change the number of plots per row.

Finally, when `Question` is selected, it allows the user to choose a certain question in the drop down menu. When chosen, it shows the user the sentiment the question was given.

Also in the left sidebar there is the option to change the number of most frequent words to be calculated. You can choose anywhere from the most used word to the 20 most used words. You can also choose any where from 1 to 5 bar charts to be displayed.
