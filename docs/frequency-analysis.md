Frequency analysis, which is also known as counting letters, is a useful study within the field of computer science. This is due to its function because it is being capable of outputting the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext.

Frequency analysis is a study that can be found within our GatorMinor. A GatorMinor user can use frequency analysis by inputting the path_to_file for each markdown assignment he/she would like to run studies on. Then an user can run a a frequency analysis study on chose markdown assignments.

Now, there are three types of frequency analysis within the analysis mode of frequency analysis. There is overall, student, and question.

The "overall" type of frequency analysis will output a list of words, for each assignment, most frequently used in a hierarchical descending fashion. The most used words will be at the top of the list and the least used words will be at the bottom of the list. The amount of times each word was used will be labeled on the x-axis. An user can use overall frequency analysis to see what each assignment is about and if a majority of people are understanding the point of an assignment.

The "student" type of frequency analysis is very similar to the overall type of frequency analysis. It will display the same information in the same fashion. However, an user of this type of frequency analysis will be able to select as many users as he/she wants and compare the usage of words between each user. This type of frequency analysis can show, a user of GatorMinor, if an assignment is similar to another submission.

The "question" type of frequency analysis will allows an user of GatorMinor to select questions in an assignment. An user can select one questions or as many questions as they want. The output will display the most used words, for an answer, to a question that is selected. It will display the information in the same fashion as other types of frequency analysis and this can be useful when a GatorMinor user wants to see if submissions are understanding a certain questions or not.
