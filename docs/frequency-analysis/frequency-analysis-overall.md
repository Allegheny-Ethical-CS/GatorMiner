The "overall" type of frequency analysis will output a list of words,
for each assignment, most frequently used in a hierarchical descending fashion.
The most used words will be at the top of the list and the least used words will be at the bottom of the list.
The amount of times each word was used will be labeled on the x-axis.
An user can use overall frequency analysis to see what each assignment is about and if a majority of people are understanding the point of an assignment.
