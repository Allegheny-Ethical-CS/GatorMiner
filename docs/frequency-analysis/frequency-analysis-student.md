The "student" type of frequency analysis is very similar to the overall type of frequency analysis.
It will display the same information in the same fashion.
However, an user of this type of frequency analysis will be able to select as many users as
he/she wants and compare the usage of words between each user.
This type of frequency analysis can show, a user of GatorMinor,
if an assignment is similar to another submission.
