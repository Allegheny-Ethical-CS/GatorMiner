Frequency analysis is used, in our case, within GatorMiner because
we are counting the frequency of meaningful words and phrases and filtering out stopwords.
It is a useful study within the field of computer science due to its capability in outputting
the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext.

GatorMiner uses frequency analysis by taking in the directory path
of a collection of markdown files. The user can then run
a frequency analysis study on the chosen markdown assignments.
