# Topic Modeling

## What is it?

Topic modeling analyzes documents to find keywords in order to determine the documents' dominant topics.

Within the GatorMiner tool, you have the ability to choose `Topic Modeling` as an analysis option after the path to the desired reflection documents is submitted.#

## How does it work?

When the tool runs a topic modeling analysis it provides 2 different options to choose from in the left sidebar:

- Histogram
- Scatter

When `Histogram` is selected, the application will display a histogram in which the dominant topic is on the x-axis and the count of records is on the y-axis. A legend in the top right corner will display the names of the reflection files new to the color that corresponds with them.

When `Scatter` is selected, the application will display a scatter plot. The legend on the right side will display the colors that correspond to topic numbers and the shapes that correspond with topics.

Sliders are also provided that can adjust the amount of topics or adjust the amount of words per topic.
