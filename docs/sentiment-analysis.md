Sentiment analysis is the process of using text analysis to
identify and study states of emotion in regards to the input, which is subjective information.
Sentiment analysis is able to identify the amount of sentiment each user has
for what it is processing. It will give numbers based on each users sentiment.

The sentiment analysis will output numbers within a range of -1 to 1.
The range represents a scale because an output of -1 shows negative sentiment,
an output of 0 shows neutral sentiment, and an output of 1 shows positive sentiment.
Therefore, an sentiment analysis output of -.8, will show an user had more
negative wording and phrases regarding the assignment.
