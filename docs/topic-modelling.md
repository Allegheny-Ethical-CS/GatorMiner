The topic modeling analyzer is an analyzing system that takes keywords and implements them into a graph that demonstrates the frequency they were used from each person. It doesn't take the number of times those keywords were used but rather if they were used from certain users. If one of the keywords was used it will be put into either a histogram graph or a scatter chart. You can also change the number of topics and the amount of words per topic. For example, if we were to try and find the keyword "keyword" in one of the files that is scanned, it would show both the total number of times that word is used in that file and which person said that specific word. In addition, you can compare the number of times a person were to use the word "keyword" to other files that you can compare to.
