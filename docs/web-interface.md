# Web Interface

GatorMiner is mainly developed on its web interface with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) in order to provide fast text analysis and visualizations.

In order to run the `Streamlit` interface, type and execute the following command in your terminal:

```
pipenv run streamlit run streamlit_web.py
```

You then will see something like this in your terminal window:
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://xxx.xxx.x.x:8501
```

The web interface will automatically be opened in your browser:
