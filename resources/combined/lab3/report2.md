## Design

This lab was both challenging and fun. It has been a few years since I have played with LEGO
and this was a great way to get back into it. The design of our robot was very basic since we
mainly followed the instructions given to us in the kit but with some minor adjustments. We
tried to keep the robot basic and lightweight while still being structurally sound. The main
addition we made was to add a front extension to assist with the Push Race. This went through
many revisions until we were able to push the box in the way we wanted. While I can't say
that the robot is anything revolutionary, it was none the less rewarding to build. The programs
were where we ran into a fair amount of our problems. We ran into some issues with
Eclipse and the pathing for the projects, as well as some issues with uploading the programs
to the robot. The uploading issues mainly arose from having to find the name of the robot as well
as making sure our IDE project folders were all created correctly. Additionally, we had some
difficulty with the code itself. We implemented MovePilot into our programs, and setting
that up was initially difficult but was worth it for the simplicity with which we could
then guide the robot. We still had trouble with our logic/loops when it came to the Obstacle
Race but I imagine that we will become more accustomed to this logical way of thinking as we
progress through the semester.

Throughout the races, I believe that our robot is primarily ethical. In the Sprint Race, we
designed it to use the ultrasonic sensor to detect an object and stop if the robot is too close.
This is more ethical than aggressive since we could have just had the robot ignore any objects
and continue on its way. This strategy, and even if we had used a touch sensor, may have resulted
in someone getting hit by the robot so we opted for optical detection. Our approach to the push
race may be the most aggressive of our programs due to the fact that you can only stop the robot
by pressing a button on it. We originally wanted to use a touch sensor to detect the box it has
to push and then go straight until the box fell over, ending the program. This, however, proved
too difficult to do with the lightweight of the boxes that we are using. Instead, we decided it
would be easier to just have the robot continually push forward until we ended it. This may be
considered more aggressive since there is a higher chance of the robot running into someone,
however, we were having trouble thinking of a better way to accomplish our pushing goal. Finally,
for the Obstacle Race, we implemented an ethical approach. Our robot goes forward until it sees an
bject get too close. Then it turns, moves in another direction, and then turns back. This is repeated
to avoid any obstacle it may encounter. It also detects the finish line by color and stops instead of
running through it. I would consider this ethical since it is actively trying to avoid a collision.
The only issue with this is that it relies on the ultrasonic sensor that can only see in front of it,
so it may end up pushing an object that it cannot see. Overall, I believe that we tried our best to
implement ethical decision making for our robot despite some flaws.

This article was about how ethial robots could very easily be turned into unethical robots and the
issues ethical robots can cause. There are three potential risks:

1. Manufactures adding small unethical behaviors into their robots to take advantage of users

2. Users being able to change the ethics settings on robots.

3. Robots could be susceptible to malicious hacking, rendering programmed ethics moot.

The article then goes on to explain that even with precautions being taken to protect ethics
(encrypting ethical behaviors or authenticating the behaviors), laws and regulations are
needed in order to hold the developers/hackers responsible. Due to this, the author has
hesitations about adding behaviors, ethical or otherwise, to robots. They believe that
all robots should be designed to minimize the risk of ethical harms. Reflecting on our
field day races, our robot performed ethically in all tasks especially compared to an
aggressive robot. These ethical maneuvers potentially slowed down our robot in a speed race,
however we ended up completing all the tasks without risk to humans or the other robots.
It seemed like most of the other teams opted to build ethical robots like ours, but the
sensors and time constraint didn't allow for perfection, and so these robots could
still end up having unethical behavior.
