Although
we did run into a few roadblocks, it was fun to overcome those and see what types
of designs and movements worked best with the leJOS system. When it came to building
the robot, we followed the guidelines of the manual pretty closely to build the
basic structure, but then made some modifications along the way. Our robot has two
wheels and one of each of the ultrasonic, touch, light, and sound sensors. One of
the initial challenges was ensuring that all of the sensors were connected to the
right ports and that they were all in a position that would be beneficial to the
robot's movement. Another challenge we initially came across was that the arm on the
front of our robot that we use for the box pushing race extended past the touch sensor.
We added a rod onto the end of the touch sensor so that this problem was avoided and
although it was a simple solution it was an important one. Also, for style we put black rims
on the wheels because we wanted our robot to look unique. One challenge we were not
able to overcome was the light sensor. When we initially tried to calibrate the sensor
to read the red color of the paper in class on Tuesday, the sensor seemed to read it but
we could not get it to print the statement. Thus, we do have to manually stop our robot
at the end of the obstacle race.

In class, we learned about the difference between ethical and aggressive robots and their
movements. Some robots go about their objectives in an aggressive manner and have a risk-reward
factor: they can complete their tasks quickly but at the risk of messing something up. Other
robots go about their objectives in an ethical manner and thus usually complete their tasks
at a higher rate of success, but with the downside of being slower and more methodical. For
our first program for the sprint race, Trent and I set the speed of the wheels on our robot to
the maximum of 720. This is an aggressive behavior but it was an easy decision to make since the
race is in a straight line and the only objective is to be the fastest across the finish line.
For our second program for the push box race, Trent and I again decided to set the speed of the
wheels to the maximum of 720. This, again, is an aggressive behavior and one that has slightly
more risk. We want to try to win this race, but our maximum speed may give the box a higher chance
of sliding off of the arm on the front of the robot. Finally, for our third program for the
obstacle race, Trent and I programmed the robot's ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and stop
less than .3 away. This is a fairly ethical behavior because this is a conservative distance away
from obstacles. We wanted to try and ensure that our robot avoided obstacles and since this race
is easily the most intricate we decided to go the ethical route.

The article that we read, titled "Why Ethical Robots Might Not Be Such a Good Idea After All", explores the risk that actually may be associated with building or producing robots with explicitly ethical behavior. The authors describe three scenarios or factors that could result in disaster for users depending on how they are used. The first is unscrupulous manufacturers could intentionally insert unethical behaviors into the robot to exploit users. This has happened with some car manufacturers lately to try and maximize profits. The second is if a robot has user adjustable ethics settings. This could be very dangerous if the robot is in the wrong hands. For example, if the user is given access to ethics settings, things like self-driving cars could become weapons in terrorist scenarios. The third scenario is when an ethical robot is the target of malicious hacking. This factor is less avoidable because of the fact that there will always be hackers for any tech device. However, if ethical robots continue to grow in society there will no doubt be a large and important conversation had about legislation surrounding their use and safety. I agree with all of these points made in the article and I think it is of the utmost importance to ensure that the ethics of a robot are never compromised. However, when it came to our races in class, I actually believe that the more ethical, conservative robots performed better. Our robot was not the fastest but still came in second in the sprint race and first in the obstacle race. The robots that were aggressive and tried to finish quickly often crashed or veered off course.
