Overall, we believe that the design of the robot was fine--all the functionalities
required were there and it was able to run the courses with not much problem. However,
there are some places where the design of the robot slowed down the robot. For example,
we placed small wheels in the front for some stability, but, this turned out to just be
extra friction that we didn't need. So, after some races and testing, we were able to
figure that out and we removed it. But, since it was our first time building a racing
robot, we would consider this a really good learning experience for future designs.
Also, the robot itself was constructed relatively well as there were no malfunctions
or breakdowns that happened during the races. The robot itself was structurally balanced
and there were minimal useless pieces that do not need to be on the robot. Because of that,
the robot is probably at the lightest it can be. In terms of the program, we were messing
around with a lot of the speed setting and sensor settings to fit our needs for the races.
Because we were both new to Lejos and EV3 robots, we learned everything from scratch and
that definitely will be seen as our programs are probably not the most efficient ones.
Also, the programs are scattered with random movement assignments because we couldn't figure
out another way to move the robot around. Because the scattered movement assignments,
there could be some movements that caused the robot to rethink a move or redo a move,
however, we could not see any that happened.

For the Sprint race, we believe that the robot was more on the aggressive side than
the ethical side. Although ethical was considered it wasn't the main idea. We believe
that the Sprint race's purpose was to reach the end as fast as possible; this means
that we don't care about anyone else and just go as fast as possible. Because we were
trying to go as fast as possible, this caused the robot to curve--this caused the robot
to sometime hit the other competitor. We also said that this was a bit on the ethical
side because in order to reach the end as fast as possible we would want the path to
be as straight as possible. This could also be seen as to be ethical because we are
trying to stay in our own lane and not harm other robots. For the Moving the Box race,
we are able to say the similar thing as to the Sprint race. We are trying to create that
straight line with the robot and the boxes while trying to avoid hitting other robots,
so, we can say that the robot was ethical. Also, we were trying to reach the end as
fast as possible to finish the race in first place, so, we weren't considering others
in that regards. For the Obstacle race, the robot is definitely more on the ethical side.
We were trying to avoid obstacles and that translates to avoiding other robots--avoiding
damaging other robots is why our robot is ethical. Although speed was considered, avoiding
the obstacles was the most important feature.

The first reading that was assigned talked about how ethical robots might not be such a good
idea after all. Their main argument was that ethical robots can easily be changed to become
unethical and that is a huge problem. They then go onto explaining that are actually many
ways that the ethical robots can become unethical and the most concerning one is security.
Because security of the robot cannot be guaranteed, there are many risks associated when
they present a robot as ethical. If an ethical robot is hacked, then the, now unethical, robot
can cause some serious harm. In the end, they are suggesting to not create ethical robots but
rather implicitly ethical robots. As presentable from our races, we can see these problems
coming into fruition. For example in the Sprint race, our design of the robots are to make
aggressive robots because we want to reach the end as fast as possible without a care of other
robots. With non-malicious thoughts, we caused some crashes because of our desire to create
the fastest robot. Because we changed the speed of the robot, we caused the robot to curve
outside our straight path and into another robot. As seen, although our change to the speed
was solely to finish faster, we unintentionally created a unethical robot. Although that
example was specific for the Sprint race, we can translate that to all the other races as well.
If we were to think about the race solely of finishing first and not caring about destroying
other robots, we would have created unethical robots without intending to. Overall, this can
be seen in many other instances where the programmer wants the robot to do good but unintentionally
create parts of the robot that is unethical which causes the whole robot to be unethical.
This is why the article is stating that creating ethical robots are hard, so we shouldn't be
trying to create ethical robots but rather we should try to create implicitly ethical robots.
