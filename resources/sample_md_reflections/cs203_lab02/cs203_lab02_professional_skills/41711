## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

The only concern I have so far is that if there is too many of us working on a simple implementation of the feature than many of us may end up unable to
make any meaningful contributions. This has not been a problem yet, however, so I will have to wait and see how this way of team-based software engineering
works out.
