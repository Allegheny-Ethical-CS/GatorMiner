## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

I would say everyone not being on the same page. We have students who are working with different 
types of computers, software, and software development knowledge. For example, my computer has had
a problem with downloading GatorMiner while others in my group haven't. It has been a slight set back 
but I would believe that would be one of the bigger problems.
