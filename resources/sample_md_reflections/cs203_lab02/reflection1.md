- Third task
  * Started reading into other Docker files from different classes and using online sources to start developing a Dockerfile and image for GatorMiner.

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

I would like to practice reading error codes better, so I can be self sufficient in solving my machines common and basic errors. As well as learn more about docker images to able to create one with my group.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

I think that effective communication between team members is very important, and I feel my team has been doing a very good job with this.
