### Scrum Meeting Three (3/25/21)

- What did you since last meeting?

Finalized the installation for GatorMiner, had a successful run.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

We determined our how to approach our jobs and how we were planning accomplishing our tasks.

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

There was a simple implementation that we tried, but it did not work initially. It took a few iterations to get a model that would be ideal to move forward.

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- First task

Learn how to overcome dependencies discrepancies.

- Second task

Communicate within the team to determine tasks.

- Third task

Work with Github and minimize double coding.

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- First task

Pull GatorMiner to begin the project

- Second task

Install required dependencies.

- Third task

Build GatorMiner environment and run

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

Please provide a response to this question.
I would like to practice working with the Github flow model more often with a team. Working with a team is different then working independently, where you need to communicate and focus on pulling before making changes and have to talk to each other.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

Please provide a response to this question.
Just like with the task that I would like to work on most, working in a group requires a large amount of collaboration. This can be difficult and I am somewhat concerned about this, but as we work more in a group this should become more natural.

3/30/21 Update
Progress:
Finished file upload and fixed linting errors

Issues:
Gensim and linux checks in Github, and single file upload

Future:
Next meeting we will be assigning new roles for everyone and moving selecting the next issue to work on.
