## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (3/17)

- What did you do since last meeting?

I tried downloading and running GatorMiner and failed, as I realized that I could not run it within Docker. As a result, I had to go back to troubleshooting an issue I have been having with running python locally since last semester.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

Work on troubleshooting my issues with Python and retrying the run for GatorMiner.

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

The only obstacle currently is that I don't have Python properly installed on my machine.

### Scrum Meeting Two (3/19)

- What did you since last meeting?

I further troubleshooted my issue with Python and found that my best next step would be to uninstall and delete all of the remnants of the previous Python installation. Knowing that, my next best step would be to install the newest version of Python

- What will you do before the next meeting?

Install the newest version of Python and pipenv

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Not that I can tell.

### Scrum Meeting Three (3/21)

- What did you since last meeting?

I installed the newest version of Python but found that I needed to revert it to Python 3.8 to properly run GatorMiner. I installed Python 3.8 and was able to run GatorMiner, with the exception of a ModuleNotFoundError for gensim.summarization.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

Try and fix my issues with GatorMiner

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

The ModuleNotFoundError :(

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- Using ZenHub
- Attending all meetings
- Communicating with and actively participating with my group members

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- Running Python programs with pyenv and pipenv
- Running streamlit
- Setting up GatorMiner

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

One task I would like to practice more is to plan out my time better so that I can complete assignments in a more timely fashion, with less additional stress on me.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

I have no concerns about team-based software engineering at this time.
