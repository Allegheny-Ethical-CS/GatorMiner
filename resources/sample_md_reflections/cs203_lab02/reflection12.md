## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

I will like to practice utilizing the GatorMiner program because I am very intrigued with how it operates. I was able to build the program but I am still having difficulties trying to test the program because I still have to run some functionality on my computer for the testing to work. I am very interested in the idea of GatorMiner so I would like to practice using this program more in the future.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern about team-based software engineering is trying to figure out the best time we can meet together and work because of everyone's schedules. My team have had some difficulty with that but we have been able to work past that thankfully and it has not put a wrinkle in any of our future plans. However, right now, that remains my biggest concern compared to everything else.
