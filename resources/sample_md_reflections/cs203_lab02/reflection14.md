Yes.

## Did you observe someone who did not follow the code of conduct? Who? How?

No.

## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (2/9/21)

- Since last meeting, we made the code of conduct that outlined how we would work together and how infractions would be handled and made the assessment document that outlined how our labs and assignments would be assessed. We also completed lectures and readings to teach us the basics of Github flow and the agile software development model.
- Before the next meeting, we aim to install and practice using GatorMiner on our computers.
- An obstacle is that none of us have installed GatorMiner or done a lot of work with it's dependencies before, and we all have different operating systems, so installing GatorMiner presents various challenges.

### Scrum Meeting Two (2/11/21)

- Since last meeting, we all took steps towards installing and using GatorMiner, and using the Zenhub board. Some of us were still stuck on issues related to ``gensim`` or on issues specific to our operating system with installing GatorMiner, although I was successfully able to install and use it on my Linux with the help of TA Enpu. A lot of us also couldn't yet get edit access to the Zenhub board.
- Before the next meeting, we will keep working to properly install and use Gatorminer and use the Zenhub board. Since I have properly installed GatorMiner, I will test and examine it's various features and look for issues with it that people could work on. I will also keep trying to get edit access to the Zenhub board.
- I seem to be having an issue with the Zenhub board giving me edit access as opposed to being a read-only user despite proper access to the repositories.

### Scrum Meeting Three (2/14/21)

- My team continued to work on installing, getting oriented to, and looking for issues on GatorMiner. I tested the various features of GatorMiner and also ran the suggested ``pytest`` and found the markdown linting error that was referenced in an existing issue.
- Before the next meeting, I will continue to get familiar with GatorMiner and work towards identifying an issue to work on and tasks for that issue. I will also help my teammates that haven't been able to install and properly use GatorMiner with their installation as I am able.
- There are some obstacles currently in our way. First, I am the only one on my team that has been able to properly install GatorMiner and also the only one with a Linux operating system, which may have been why I was able to properly install it. Second, our team still isn't entirely clear on how we break down the issues into tasks using the Zenhub board, which our team scrum lead slack messaged the professor about, and only three of us are able to access Zenhub board.

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- Learned about how Zenhub could be used as an online shared interface to track issues, user stories, and tasks.
- Practiced discussing progress and issues with others during scrum meetings.
- Practiced organizing teams and comparing skills to find roles within a team for a longer-term software engineering project.

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- Successfully installed and built the GatorMiner software that we will be working on during this software engineering cycle.
- Learned more about the ```pipenv``` virtual environment and why it is important to install the dependencies for it regularly.
- Tested the GatorMiner software using ``pytest`` and identified various issues that could be worked on.

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

A task that I want to pracitce more is using and updating GatorMiner. GatorMiner is a tool that I would like to learn more about because I am interested in it's functionalities of text mining and data visualization. I am hoping that learning more about the tool and helping to update it will get me more familiar with how to implement these functionalities.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern about team-based software engineering is all of the technical issues that can arise with many different systems attempting to work on the same software. I have been the only person on my team able to install GatorMiner so far and a lot of people also haven't been able to edit the Zenhub board. I am concerned about the possibility of these major technical issues persisting and making communication and collaboration even harder, especially being the remote format that we are in.
