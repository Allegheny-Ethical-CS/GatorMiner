## Did you follow the code of conduct during the completion of this project?

Yes, I followed the code of conduct during the completion of this project.

## Did you observe someone who did not follow the code of conduct? Who? How?

No, there was no one that did not follow the code of conduct. There was some issues on when to meet, but that was resolved very quickly through communication so there were no violations in my eyes.

## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (3/17/21)

- What did you since last meeting?

This was out meeting during the lab. As this was our first meeting, we were trying to sort out what we have to do for this sprint as well as properly install the software into our devices.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

Our goal is to have successfully installed GatorMiner to our devices and understand how to use it.

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

The only obstacles we faced at this point in time is trying to understand exactly what we were supposed to do, but this became clearer as I talked to the professor and consulted the project outline document.

### Scrum Meeting Two (Date)

- What did you since last meeting?

I installed the GatorMiner program into my device and made sure that it was working properly. I input some sample data and tried to go through the features to get a better understanding of the program.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

Come up with new tasks and issues to add to the ZenHub board.

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

I personally did not face difficulties with the installation as I have a MacOS, but I know that my group members are having trouble with it as they both have Windows OS.

### Scrum Meeting Three (Date)

- What did you since last meeting?

Come up with potential issues that can be added to the ZenHub board.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

We will try to pick an issue to work on in future sprints going forward.

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

ZenHub was giving us trouble when we were trying to add issues to the board. For me, although it allowed me to create the issue, it did not let me add labels to it, while my other team mate could not even create an issue.

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- First task

Reading and understanding the task at hand

- Second task

Proper communication with my team mates

- Third task

Consulting the instructor as well as the technical leaders when facing problems

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- First task

Properly installing GatorMiner and its dependencies onto my device

- Second task

Configuring and using GatorMiner on my device

- Third task

Understanding and using ZenHub and its various features

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

I want to practice using ZenHub more. I feel like ZenHub has a lot of features it has to offer and that I should be accustomed to it if I want to be successful or even have smooth progress during this project. I also want to be accustomed with GatorMiner since it is the main focus of our project, and it would make it easier to work on if I understand the program properly.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern about team-based software engineering is the fact that it is a team based activity. There are a lot of moving parts in it, as there are multiple groups working on the project as well as multiple team members in those groups. So organizing all these individual parts to make a successful project would be difficult in my opinion.
