## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- Working with the technical leaders to attempt to get GatorMiner to work correctly.
- Ensuring that my team is keeping up to date with one another on what tasks need done.
- Communicating with my team to complete needed tasks at hand.

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- Reinstalling dependencies to attempt to get GatorMiner to function correctly.
- Continuing to troubleshoot why dependencies will not function on my machine.
- Contributing with my team to the GatorMiner ZenHub board.

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

I want to practice my skills in troubleshooting how to fix my dependencies in order to run programs like GatorMiner. I want to do this because I have been struggling with this quite a bit and I feel that understanding how to fix this on my own would be incredibly beneficial.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern about team-based software engineering is communications between one another in a remote environment, because personal technical issues create even further space between one another and makes for harder communication.
