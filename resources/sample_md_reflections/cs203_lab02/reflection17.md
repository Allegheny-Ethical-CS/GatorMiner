## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (Date)

- Try to get the program to run properly.
- Try to fix the problem preventing the program from running or at least identify the outlying issue.
- Fully installing and running the program without any kind of error message.

### Scrum Meeting Two (Date)

- I managed to get the streamlit to work properly and added documentation to the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
- I plan on reading some more of the streamlit upload file documentation and try to see if I can figure out how to input test files from my system.
- Right now, I am currently unable to test input cases using the streamlit.

### Scrum Meeting Three (Date)

- Find out what was at least partially to blame for making me unable to test file inputs
- Be able to input paths to files I wish to test
- My system is having an issue with some of the python script dealing with encoding specific utf-8 characters.

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- Joined a team and helped organized the weeks tasks.
- Participated in the slack lab channel to help solve bugs and errors.
- Helped identify the cause of some common issues with the GatorMiner program.

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- Identified and fixed an issue relating to upgrading Windows Visual C++ to version 14.00+
- Contributed to the CONTRIBUTING.md document with instructions for running GatorMiner on windows.
- Fixed an issue preventing python from reading utf-8 properly.

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

I feel that my ability to read documentation for the tools I am using could use some more practice. Many of the issues I encounter may have been more
easily solved if the first place I looked was the required dependencies for the tools I am using or some of the documentation on known problems.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

The only concern I have so far is that if there is too many of us working on a simple implementation of the feature than many of us may end up unable to
make any meaningful contributions. This has not been a problem yet, however, so I will have to wait and see how this way of team-based software engineering
works out.
