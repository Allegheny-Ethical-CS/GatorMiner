## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (Date)

- What did you since last meeting?

This was the day that we were assigned the project and were put into our groups. During this meeting we downloaded the repository and worked out way to open the website through GatorMiner. Two teammates were able to do this without any errors while two other teammates had many problems. Additionally, we assigned our Scrum leader.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

We will make sure all our python problems are solved and all of us can access the website.

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

There are no obstacles in our teams way besides lack of knowledge to solve python problems. We will have to stay engaged with a TL to fix this problem.

### Scrum Meeting Two (3/21/21)

- What did you since last meeting?

Our teammates that were not able to access the website have gained access through solving technical problems. Furthermore, we have brainstormed what we want to tackle within our project. We have thought of using linting and frequency type coding in order to do this project.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

We will ensure we have a good understanding of the direction we want to move in regarding the project.
