  No. Seems like it will work fine and even if there is an error or two they should be easy fixes.

  Finished getting the GatorMiner program to run locally on my machine.
- What will you do before the next meeting?
  Start reading the contributing.md file to know what is expected of my contributions.

  Nope. All I have to do is read and start getting ready for our first task next week.

### Scrum Meeting Three (03/23)

- What did you since last meeting?
  Read most of the documentation and code so I can be most prepared for our first task.
- What will you do before the next meeting?
  Begin our first task in the lab sesson on 03/24.

  Not sure yet. There could be difficulties with the first task but we haven't gotten it yet so I don't know.

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- First task
  Communication. We communicated as group over scrum meetings and slack all week long.
- Second task
  Teamwork. We divided up task as a team and helped each other out with getting GatorMiner to run.
- Third task
  Problem Solving. When other group members were having trouble with GatorMiner I was able to problem solve with them and help out.

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- First task
  Terminal Commands. Had to use various terminal commands to install and run GatorMiner.
- Second task
  Environment setup. Had to install dependencies and python modules to be able to run GatorMiner.
- Third task
  Github. To contribute to GatorMiner we will have to be familiar with git flow.

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

Please provide a response to this question.

We didn't really do anything that difficult this week so I don't really think I have a good answer to this question. Everything went pretty seemlessly.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

Please provide a response to this question.

I'm not concerned about working in a team at all. It's a really important part of software engineering and it's a really good thing that we are learning it in a controlled classroom setting.
