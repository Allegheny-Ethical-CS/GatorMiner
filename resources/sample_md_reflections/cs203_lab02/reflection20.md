## Did you follow the code of conduct during the completion of this project?

Yes I did follow the Code of Conduct for the whole time during the completion of this project.

## Did you observe someone who did not follow the code of conduct? Who? How?

During the completion of this assignment, I haven't seen anyone violate the Code of Conduct.

## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (Thursday,18th March )

- What did you since last meeting: Since this is our first meeting, the last time we gathered together was not a scrum meeting. But we did met and talk to each other prior to forming the group in order to fully understand the strength and weaknesses of each individual.

- What will you do before the next meeting: We need to figure out how to get the GatorMinor on the end of Adam and Batmukth have. Adam was encounters an error with C++ configuration while Batmukth couldn't run `pipenv` or locate `pipenv` on his computer.

- Are there any obstacles in your way: Since half of the team couldn't run the program so the whole team were not at the same page. And since this is the first time we see the code and experience this kind of issue, we have to rely a lot on TL to solve this complication.

### Scrum Meeting Two (Sunday, 21st March)

- What did you since last meeting: We were trying to get GatorMiner run on Adam and Batmukth computer and we finally get it run thanks to Noor. In this meeting, we were discuss what other potential features should be added to GatorMiner and practice creating user stories according to the features.

- What will you do before the next meeting: Try to break down the user stories into a collection of tasks and pick one issue/user story to add into ZenHub Board. This issue should be clear and feasible so the team will be able to tackle.

- Are there any obstacles in your way: We came up with some complicated idea that sounds good but very complicated. Thus, it's really hard to break it down into tasks since we don't really know how to accomplish that idea, for example: analyze amount of linting errors in the class, analyze spelling and grammar error in the reflections.

### Scrum Meeting Three (Tuesday, 23rd March)

- What did you since last meeting: We finally decided that we will put the error that Adam was having when running GatorMiner, which is the problem with Microsoft C++ as the issue that we will put into ZenHub.

- What will you do before the next meeting: We still have to try to break down our selected user stories into a collection of tasks.

- Are there any obstacles in your way: We still have the same problem as last meeting, our knowledge is not enough to split an user idea into tasks. We need to do more research and go to meet TLs to be able to get through this obstacles.

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- First task: I have a great communication with clients since I used to intern at a Human Resource department of a large company. I was taught to interact with client in a specific manner and understand the general steps to resolve a problem with a client. There's a day I have to communicate to more than 30 clients through phone, email and in-person.
- Second task: I have a lot of team experience in and out of our Computer Science department.
- Third task: I am able to learn things individually and with the team by using open source documentation and software.

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- First task: Be able to run Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv` successfully
- Second task: Be able to run and use `pylint` and `flake8` in Python and understand the error report from running these linting test. Then, be able to check and fix these linting error until all error are cleared.
- Third task: Be able to write basic testing case of Python programs with `pytest`, also able to use `coverage test` to see the degree of testing completion in the program. Then improve and write more test case accordingly.

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

I want to practicing building user stories and split user stories into reasonable collection of tasks. By having this practice, the team work and communication amongst teammates will be improve, this is very important in software engineering. I also want to practice estimating the amount of time each task might need since this is also another important feature in software engineering.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

Clearly it's the amount of knowledge of us towards this project. We have to read through the code thoroughly and figure out what should we do and what can I do to add more features into the program.
