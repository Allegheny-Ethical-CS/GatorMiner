## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (3/18)

- What did you since last meeting? Attempted to install dependencies needed to run GatorMiner.
- What will you do before the next meeting? I will try to make sure that I have everything installed, and familiarize myself with GatorMiner.
- Are there any obstacles in your way? There were several issues with doing the installations, and I saw many of my classmates having the same issues.

### Scrum Meeting Two (3/22)

- What did you since last meeting? I worked a bit on learning about the program.
- What will you do before the next meeting? Try to fix some of these issues tonight that I'm having with my terminal window.
- Are there any obstacles in your way? Same as before, with various installations, but the Slack channel is helping.

### Scrum Meeting Three (Date)

- What did you since last meeting? I fixed the issues I had.
- What will you do before the next meeting? I'm going to learn more about GatorMiner.
- Are there any obstacles in your way? Not currently, but there's always that chance that something goes wrong of course.

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- First task: Met with my team and discussed what we needed to do.
- Second task: Figured out what each team member could be responsible for figuring out, as we all ran into multiple issues.
- Third task: Learned about scrum meetings, figuring out a time that works for all of us.

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- First task: Downloaded and installed GatorMiner.
- Second task: Learned how ZenHub, and interacted with the board.
- Third task: Installed several dependencies that are needed to use the program.

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

I  need to learn more about GatorMiner.  It seems like a really cool tool to use, and I am excited to actually work with its core programming, but in order to actually improve it I am going to need to learn a lot more.  It is already pretty complex in its current state, and if I am to be of any use in improving it, I simply need to work with it more.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

Well, for starters, the class as a whole seems to still be having trouble with the GatorMiner software, and getting it running seems to be a hassle.  Also, everyone's programming knowledge is varied, so different teams might not be able to implement the same level of concepts as others.  Furthermore, I have never worked in a team this large at all, and even though we are split into smaller groups, the class is still working together as a unit.  I still have high hopes for the team, but I'm sure there are gonna be several obstacles along the way.
