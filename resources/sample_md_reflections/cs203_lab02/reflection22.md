## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (3/17/21)

- Since there was no last meeting, we all worked on getting used to being able to run GatorMiner on our machines.
- Before the next meeting we will familiarize ourselves with the code base and understand further how to execute the tool.
- Some errors have occurred regarding the Pipenv.lock file for a lot of the team members, so this may be an obstacle moving forward.

### Scrum Meeting Two (3/19/21)

- Since last meeting, the majority of the team members resolved execution issues and were able to familiarize with the tool.
- Before the next meeting, the team and I plan to look at the ZenHub board and think of issues that we would like to tackle.
- There are still some team members who are unable to run the tool so this could become an issue if not resolved soon.

### Scrum Meeting Three (3/23/21)

- As a team we compiled a list of issues that we feel we could face in the future.
- Before the next meeting, we will explore `issue #40` and see how we can make meaningful contributions to this issue.
- The ability for each person to work asynchronously and still understand their role in the team and what they are supposed to do could be an issue but I think our team will be ok on this end.

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

After completing this weeks lab assignment, I would like to improve my GitHub flow skills. Although I am able to perform basic tasks using the flow model, I think that improving my skills with this technology will ultimately allow my contributions to projects to be even more meaningful and helpful. This semester I have been shown the importance of good organization when developing and contributing to open source software so it is definitely a skill that I will continue to work on bettering.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

I think that moving forward my biggest concern about team-based software engineering is how to get all group members to collaborate especially when meeting in person is almost impossible at this time. I think that it is possible to overcome this but the fact that it is more of an issue than it has previously ever been is a definite cause for concern.
