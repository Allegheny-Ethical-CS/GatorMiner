## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (3/16/2021)

- What did you since last meeting?

As this was our first ever meeting, I had not done anything previous to it yet.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

I will get help with my Python issues in order to run the program.

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

The obstacle in my way is that certain Python related commands are not working properly for me.

### Scrum Meeting Two (3/19/2021)

- What did you since last meeting?

I got assistance with my Python issues and installed the dependencies for the program.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

I will run the program to make sure everything is working and get accustomed to how the program is used.

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

I did not have any obstacles in my way.

### Scrum Meeting Three (Date)

- What did you since last meeting?

I ran the program and used the sample reflections to see how you can use the program to analyse. I also installed the ZenHub browser extension so it is easily accessible from GitHub.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

I will look over the existing issues and try to think of more in preparation of picking tasks for our group to tackle. I will also take a closer look at the GatorMiner's contributing guideline to ensure that I follow it when I make additions.

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

There are currently no obstacles in my way.

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- First task

I participated in scrum meetings with my group.

- Second task

I used Slack to communicate and coordinate with my group.

- Third task

I attempted to answer any questions that my group members asked.

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- First task

I got Python and its Pip commands working on my machine.

- Second task

I ran the necessary commands to get the program to run and practiced using it.

- Third task

I familiarized myself with ZenHub and the currently existing issues in the GatorMiner repository.

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

I will need more practice with developing user stories and converting them into tasks. Currently, I am very unsure of my ability to do so. I hope that working on this project will help me get better at doing this.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

After completing this sprint, I am concerned about being a burden to my team. I am concerned that my lack of skills and experience may cause me to fall behind or not be as productive as other members are.
