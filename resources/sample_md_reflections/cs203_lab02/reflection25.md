## Did you follow the code of conduct during the completion of this project?

During the installation and running of both the gator miner and the zenhub board, I followed all code of conducts rules. There was some difficulty installing and running the gator miner application. Our group members leaned on each other a little to help resolve this issue during the last lab session. Our overall goal for this lab was to have all of our systems operational in both the zenhub board and the gator miner application.

## Did you observe someone who did not follow the code of conduct? Who? How?

## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (March 21st)

- This was our first team meeting. We decided who the scrum leader would be for our group
- We had discussed having all applications working and using the following zenhub board to make sure it was available to us.
- We have to make sure we schedule a weekly meeting time as it may be difficult with four busy schedules to meet as often as we would like.

### Scrum Meeting Two (Slack Messaging)

- The second meeting was voided due to time restraint and the availability of group members.
- We had discussed having all applications working and using the following zenhub board to make sure it was available to us. For those who had successful installation were to explore the code in a deeper meaning to get an in-depth understanding.
- We wanted to make sure we have a better setup to allow us to meet in between class times.

### Scrum Meeting Three (In-Class March 23rd)

- It was confirmed that everyone had installed the software successfully and could fully run the program
- Explore the zenhub board and come up with a feature to add to gator miner
- Set a weekly meeting schedule

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- Met with team members and workout goals
- Apply skills and meeting times weekly
- Set team member goals

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- Installation of Gator Miner
- Running Gator Miner
- Edit the Zenhub Board

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

This weeks project was mainly setup and making sure all things were operational. This is now set which allows us to work freely in the code ahead. One thing I would like to work on is working on the same code as someone else simultaneously. This is the idea of branching in github. This attribute I want to work more with as I had a lot of conflict errors during out first lab and during the code of conduct document.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

Overall I am confident in our group members to contribute something worth while for our group lab submissions. I think one thing that worries me is the changes that other groups may make. There could be an instance where similar parts of code are changed and could lead to some issues when merging all features into main. I think meeting more often than what is listed, even if it is only a few team members, would be beneficial to work on our code more often so we are all on the same page and can finish our work within a realistic time frame.
