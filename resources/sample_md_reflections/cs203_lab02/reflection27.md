## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One 3/17/2021

- What did you since last meeting?

This was our first meeting so there wasn't much that we could do until after the scrum meeting was finished and we had made our layout.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

I had experience some problems regarding the access to GatorMiner more specifically with the installation of pipenv. What I will do for the next meeting is figure out how to resolve this issue so that there aren't any problems and will continue with the project without bugs.

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Yes. As explained before I was having problems regarding the access to GatorMiner and the installation of pipenv. Fortunately the fix is simple and all I have to do is install some add-ons using visual studio.

### Scrum Meeting Two 3/21/2021

- What did you since last meeting?

I had installed the add-on necessary in order to access GatorMiner and install pipenv.

- What will you do before the next meeting?

Create a user story that we can use in order to take our first steps to creating a project

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Knowing the criteria of the project

### Scrum Meeting Three 3/23/2021

- What did you since last meeting?

Attempted to create rough drafts on user stories that we can use to help guide our project

- What will you do before the next meeting?

Narrow down our options for the which user story we will use, and create a timeline on tasks for our project.

- Are there any obstacles in your way?

I still don't know what the criteria are for the project.

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

What I want to practice is being able to further my understanding of github and how to connect to it using software that we create.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern is being able to gather enough information to create a project that will connect with the user story in a manner that won't be completely above our level of understanding.
