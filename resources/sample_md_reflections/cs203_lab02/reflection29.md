## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- I actively communicated with the members on my team.
- I communicate with my group about what I did to get GatorMiner, to possibly help them with their tasks
- I was present and active in all of the scrum meetings/ lab period.

- I navigated the ZenBoard board.

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

One task I want to practice more is thinking through user stories to help me develop tasks that are manageable for me and my skill set. This is because throughout this project we will have to come up with our own features to add to the program.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern is knowing if I will be able to properly implement the feature I choose to work own without a rigid structure of where to look in the book, or notes, or even past assignments.
