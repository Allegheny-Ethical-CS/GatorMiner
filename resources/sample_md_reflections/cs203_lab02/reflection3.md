## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

After completing this week of the project, I want to learn more about Gatorminer's intricacies in order to effectively complete detailed tasks.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

After completing this week of the project, my biggest concern about team-based software engineering is time management. With a large amount of work, splitting the work between the team members and getting it all done on time could be challenging. Though, with enough hard work, I feel that it can be accomplished.
