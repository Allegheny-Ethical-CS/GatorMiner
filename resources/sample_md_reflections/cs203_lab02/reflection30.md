## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

I wish to practice using the Zen board more and communicate with my team more.  I feel that these skills will be very vital if I am to be successful not only in this class, but after I graduate as well.  If I perform well now, I may perform well in the business world.
Project flow is very important for completion of software.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern about team-based software engineering is the lack of communication and interaction that may occur.  This week I had isses getting in touch with my team to talk about when to have our next meeting, or just general updates on what people were doing
