## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

To be honest besides getting gatorminer working I did not do much else so the only thing I could practice more is getting more comfortable with accessing gatorminer and overall getting more familiar with it.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern is the errors that come up that can take up so much of your time that keep you at one single step and keep you from being productive and getting things done efficiently.
