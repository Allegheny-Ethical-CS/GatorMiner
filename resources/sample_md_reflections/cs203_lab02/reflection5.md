    I completely reset my computer, redownloaded vscode and all my programs, and I got zenboard and gatorminer working

    No, this worked very smoothly

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

    Established team heirarchy (who the scrum leader is)

    Discussed each teammates technical skills

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

    Determined issues that were causing me not to be able to use gatorminer
- Second task
    Reset my computer
- Third task
    Reinstalled and initiated python and the entire technical infrastructure required to participate in class

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

    I want to do personal study about the details behind machine learning, which is at the heart of this project. It is a subject that I have long wanted to study for my own knowledge and this gives me a good reason.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

    My only concern so far (though there is no reason to have it yet) is that unlike an actual job where we would all be in the same office collaberating on the issues together, we are all individual students and may not have as much time to be on the same schedule.
