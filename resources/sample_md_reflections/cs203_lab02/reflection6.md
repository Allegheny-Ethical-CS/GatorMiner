- Are there any obstacles in your way?
Not really at the moment. 

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- First task
Communicating effectively with my team members
- Second task
Worked with each other in Slack to figure out which tasks we'd like to do.
- Third task
Spoke to someone with higher knowledge than I when I ran into a problem for help. 

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

Installing various dependencies depending on what error I got
- Third task
Working through problems within streamlit.py

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

A task I want to keep practicing is learning how pipenv and pip all work. It seems extremely complex
and thorough. 

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

I would say everyone not being on the same page. We have students who are working with different 
types of computers, software, and software development knowledge. For example, my computer has had
a problem with downloading GatorMiner while others in my group haven't. It has been a slight set back 
but I would believe that would be one of the bigger problems.
