## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (3-22-2021)

- What did you do since last meeting?
fix issues and trying to run the Gaterminer
- What will you do before the next meeting?
Try to fix the program, test, run the code, and understand the code with a TL
- Are there any obstacles in your way?
downloading python, I can't use the pip command for some reason. I got over that by using pip3 commands.

### Scrum Meeting Two (3-23-2021)

- What did you since last meeting?
still fixing issues on my end. Figuring out why my code or commands won't run.
- What will you do before the next meeting?
sit down with a TL tonight and figure it out.
- Are there any obstacles in your way?
pip commands and streamlit wont work.

### Scrum Meeting Three (Date)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- communication
- listening to my team members
- asking them some simple questions. Like how are things going on their end and such.

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- trouble shooting
- running streamlit
- writing test cases

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

Using streamlit. Other than that it will probably be programming in python. I still felt that I am new to python and coding as a whole.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern is that I may not be contributing to much to the team. That means I can't help them code, I can only lead them and such. Since my programming skills are not the best, I will try to make up for it with communication and leading of the team.
