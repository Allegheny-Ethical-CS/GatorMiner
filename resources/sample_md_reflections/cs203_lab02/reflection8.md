## Scrum Meetings

### Scrum Meeting One (3/18/21)

- Since last meeting, I managed to get Streamlit to work.
- Before the next meeting, I'll research how to actually implement the feature, facilitate others to run their Streamlit smoothly, and come up with the tasks.
- There were some obstacles with regard to encoding the contents of markdown files, but I managed to fix that.

### Scrum Meeting Two (3/22/21)

- Since last meeting, I implemented source code for the file uploading widget in `streamlit_web.py`.
- What I'll do before the next meeting is fixing the `scipy` error I had and then being able to test my implementation.
- The obstacle in my way is the `scipi` error.

### Scrum Meeting Three (3/23/21)

- Since last meeting, I fixed the `scipi` error and tested my implementation of the file upload widget
- What I'll do before the next meeting is create the branch for the file upload feature, debug the implementation, and
  test that implementation.
- There aren't any obstacles so far in my way.

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- Helped other people get Streamlit up and running
- Asked for help from a TL to fix some problems I had
- Also independently fixed other problems I had

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- Fix `gensim` error
- Fix `scipy` error
- Implement part of the file upload feature

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

A task I want to practice more is the actual implementation of new features because if that could be understood within a
larger open-source perspective, I could implement features much faster in other open-source projects.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

The biggest concern about team-based software engineering is that teams could be working on the same thing and then
merge conflicts could result.
