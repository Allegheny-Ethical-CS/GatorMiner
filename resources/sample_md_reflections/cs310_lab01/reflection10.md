## Arduino Project
Describe the application you have chosen to develop and provide a motivation for why it is a useful application. Include  references of all sources you have used throughout this project (URLs are sufficient).

We have chosen to develop an application that detects light and turns a flower towards the area of light.  This light sensor flower is a
useful application because it can be very helpful in real life with different businesses such as greenhouses or general plant-lovers.
It can automate the job of taking care of plants and crops and making it easier for the owner.

## Agent
Explain the characteristics/attributes of your agent, what makes it an agent (within the discussed course content), what makes it rational, what type of an agent it is, and what is its environment task (PEAS).

One characteristics of our agent is that it is reactive to the environment, specifically
the light in the environment. It also has an attribute that turns a light on when the
flower is looking for light. Our application is rational because the servo motor moves
the flower to the best possible location to keep it living.  Our application is a goal based
agent because it has only one job which is finding light and moving the flower towards it.
Our environment task falls in the S category which is 'sensors'. We use 2 photoresistors
which are sensors that detect light in the environment.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences
Discuss any challenges you have encountered during the work on this lab and describe what have you learned.

During the work of this lab, we encountered many challenges.  We have never worked
with this kind of hardware before and it was challenging to learn all of the concepts
of the bread board and Arduino uno board.  We learned about the different power outlets
on the uno board and how to connect a servo motor to both boards.  We also learned
how Photoresistors and small light bulbs worked and how they gained their power.

## Ethical Benefits and Implications
In this section, drawing on class discussions and readings, answer the following questions

1. What entities, businesses, organizations do you envision developing the type of the application you have chosen to develop?

We can envision greenhouses using this application because it can twist and turn flower
pots towards the light so that workers do not need to take the time to make sure they are
facing the light.  Different environmental study groups and organizations can also
use this application with crops in order to help farmers.

2. Who are the intended users of this technology?

Greenhouses, farmers, environmental study groups are all intended users of this
technology.

3. Who is not supposed to use this technology?

People that are not involved with studying the environment or that do not grow
plants or crops are not suppose to use this technology.

4. How can the application developed in this lab cause harm?

The application can cause harm by killing the flowers or crops by giving them
too much light that is not needed. The application could cause the flower to
turn towards very harsh and bright light that is not healthy for it.

5. What solutions could be implemented to avoid the harm or to fix the harm described above?

A solution to avoid and fix the harm is a timing feature that only turns the
crops and flowers towards the light for a fixed amount of time.  This way the
workers or famers could set the desired light for each item and that way it would
not be harmed.

## Team Work
Describe the details of your team working strategy, specifically explain how did you complete this work as a team and describe the specific contributions of each team member.

During this project, we both met to work together.  One of us would be explaining
directions and the other would be plugging in cords or connecting features. There were
a couple of instances where our schedules clashed and we had to work individually. During
these times we would work individually and then meet up to explain what we have learned
and what strides that we had finished.
