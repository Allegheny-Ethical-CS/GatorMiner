## Arduino Project
We want to develop a project where a car is able to avoid hitting objects using a distance censor. This car will have music playing, using the buzzer, and will have lights that indicate the state of the car. When the car is moving and there is nothing in its path, the green LED will be activated. Once the car approaches an object the yellow LED will activate, and the music from the buzzer will stop. If something catastrophic happens, such as the car hitting an object, the red LED will be activated.

## Agent
The agent in our project is the car, which would be characterized as a simple reflex agent. It is a simple reflex agent because because the sensor tells what to do and not to do, and will plan its next action based on the sensors. The input would be the distance sensor, and output would be the buzzer, lights, and wheels. What makes our proposed agent rational would be its path finding system. In mdl writing/report.md this path finding system it will search the area for the longest clear path and will then move in that direction.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences
We have encountered countless challenges during this lab, mainly involving hardware issues involving the actual setup of the car. During this lab we generally expected more software issues, but as mentioned previously, most of the issues were with the hardware, starting with getting the car parts and figuring out what we needed. Once that was established, we had many struggles with getting the motor to run. Once we finally figured out how to connect the wires to the Arduino board, we realized we had to solder the wires to the motor. Over the course of this lab, we learned a lot about arduino and breadboard. We all came in with different knowledge, and all contributed in the best ways we could.

## Ethical Benefits and Implications
Q) What entities, businesses, organizations do you envision developing the type of the application you have chosen to develop?

A) If this project were to be developed by a real-life business, organization, or entity, several parties that might be interested in developing such an application would include private sector entities such as self-driving companies (e.g., Uber, Lyft, and Google Waymo), traditional automobile companies with self-driving divisions such as Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, as well as public sector entities such as military organizations for different nations around the world (e.g. The U.S. Army).

Q) Who are the intended users of this technology?

A) The intended users of this technology would essentially be anyone who drives, or wants to drive. This technology is inclusive of any demographic who wishes to drive a self driving car.

Q) Who is not supposed to use this technology?

A) This technology is inclusive of all demographics, however it may be limited to people who do not have a driver’s license, people with serious health conditions, people who may be too old to drive, or people who are not legally permitted to obtain/possess a driver’s license.

Q) How can the application developed in this lab cause harm?

A) There are several scenarios in which a self driving car could cause harm, the most obvious being some kind of error or bug occurring where passengers and pedestrians’ lives are in danger. Additional errors could include those arriving on the hardware side of the application as well. For example, in a real self-driving vehicle, tire deflation's and airbag failure among other issues could contribute to the danger (and possible injury) of those both inside and outside of the vehicle as well. One issue that has also been commonly brought up when referring to the safety of self-driving vehicles is their vulnerability to hacking as well.

Q) What solutions could be implemented to avoid the harm or to fix the harm described above?

A) While some issues are certainly more difficult to deal with than others (e.g., bugs inherent to the self-driving program), software that could perform vehicle safety checks (such as those currently being employed to detect tire air pressure) could possibly help prevent issues on the hardware side of a self-driving application. Additionally, anti-virus software could also be provided to new purchasers of self-driving vehicles to ward off the potential of their vehicle being hacked by malicious actors during their time with the vehicle.

## Team Work
Describe the details of your team working strategy, specifically explain how did you complete this work as a team and describe the specific contributions of each team member.

We all learned along the way and would work together on almost every aspect of the project. We had many group meetings and sometimes got a lot of work done, and sometimes, were not able to accomplish as much as we would have liked.
