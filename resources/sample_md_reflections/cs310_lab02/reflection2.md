### Project Selection

The project that we have chosen to be implemented is Identifying and Tracking a Baseball. The reason we chose this project is because we find it really interesting how a baseball can be thrown at such different speeds and angles in order to generate different ball flights.

## Learning Agent

The methodology that we used for this learning agent was use an input which was a video and utilize algorithms to detect the speed and path of a baseball pitch. One of the main algorithms that we used was Cascade which was extremely useful in detecting the baseball pitch. The output of the program is the detection of the baseball path when it was thrown to the catcher.

## Comparative Study

The performance of the program was greatly impacted by the environment settings portrayed through the camera. For example, we were provided with two different videos. One of the videos had the batting net and the other one did not. The video with the net had a much lower performance because the program had a much harder time detecting the baseball.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

Discuss any challenges you have encountered during the work on this lab and  describe what have you learned.
While working on this lab, we encountered many different challenges when trying to calculate the ball speed of a baseball pitch. The main problem that we had was that it was very difficult to calculate the speed of the ball accurately. The main thing we learned when combating this problem is that the actual speed of the ball is determined by the frames per second of the video.

## Ethical Benefits and Implications

- What entities, businesses, organizations do you envision developing the type of the application you
  have chosen to develop? Some of the entities, businesses, organizations that we envision developing this type of application is major sports organizations such as baseball teams and even training institutes that could utilizes this technology to improve their players.

- Who are the intended users of this technology? The intended users of this technology is directed toward baseball players but
  specifically the coaches and pitchers in particular. This technology is important for the pitchers and coaches because the data that this program generates will allow them to see how they could improve to increase their ability to throw better pitches.

- Who is not supposed to use this technology? The people that is not supposed to use this technology is other types of players
  that play baseball such as outfielders because this technology does not apply to them. This technology is specifically developed for pitchers and will provide the best feedback in terms of data for this specific type of player.

- How can the application developed in this lab cause harm? This application developed in this lab can potentially cause harm
  because if other teams do not have this technology at their disposal, they can potentially make a claim that teams with this technology is cheating. This tool is so useful because it provides critical feedback for pitchers which is a major advantage if a baseball team or organization has it.

- What solutions could be implemented to avoid the harm or to fix the harm described above? A solution that could be implemented
  to avoid the harm or to fix the harm described is to make this technology more affordable. If it is more affordable more teams will be able to utilize this technology to improve their pitching.

## Team Work

While completing this project we have implemented several different strategies in order to achieve completion of this assignment on time. Initially when we were deciding what project to do we both discussed which project interested each of us more and decided to choose that one. After choosing the type of project we worked together on developing the source code. The reason we worked together while writing the code was so we were both on the same page on the various functions we were using. Along with developing the programs together we also continued this strategy when it came to the end of this project. For the reflection we also produced the `report.md` file together so we could incorporate both of our views into one file. specifically X mainly developed the source code along with the help of Y. On the other hand, Y mainly focused on the technical writing and the various programs we had to incorporate in the beginning stages of this project.
