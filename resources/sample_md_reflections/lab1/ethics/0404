## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
Bioethicists and researchers believe that it should continue as long as it is safe.  

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
People who could not give a live birth and have genetic disease are the users of this technology.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
People who want to do reproductions are banned to use this technology.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
It could create the copy of the individuals. It could be unsafe and affect people who have done the genome editing in the future.  

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
It could be developed having more fund on this technology and try to fix problems on human body. Not using it on people to reproductive, but to develop it and make it safer.
