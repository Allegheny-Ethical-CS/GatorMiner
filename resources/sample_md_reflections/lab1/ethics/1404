## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
The people making the genome editing technologies are researchers and bioethicists who want to give other scientists the ability to change an organism's DNA.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
The people using the genome editing technologies are people who want to help in the case of genetic diseases. It's the best opportunity for researchers to test the capabilities of our DNA.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
The idea of genome editing is so that people who have or are developing genetic diseases have an opportunity to possibly receive help when it comes to their disease. It also allows researchers to test the abilities of our DNA and genes and how they are able to test and see what is possible to edit or not. They should not be used for specific editing or gene enhancement unless it's going to benefit the health of the person or embryo.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
There is definitely some concern when it comes to safety and the damage that might come from gene testing. There is the risk of disease and disorders which can be affected by one or both genes being tested. There is also a worry that there is a slippery slope that could lead to its use not being for therapeutic and enhancement purposes.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
More testing and research is something that can always be done to avoid harm. They have been testing mainly on animals until enough research as been done to use human testing subjects or embryos.
