## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
This lab tackled a variety of topics we have covered in class and there is no short of options which I appreciated. One thing that stands out however, isn't technically a topic which we covered in class. I felt a new appreciation for doing labs with a teammate. Despite some of the issues and difficulties that come with collaboration, in the end, it makes a huge difference to have another person assisting with their skills, work and knowledge. All of these things allow for the lab to be completed much quicker and easier. Especially a lab with such a variety of content and code, having a teammate with whom the the load can be shared. If we did more labs similar this one in the future, I would definitely want to collaborate my efforts with that of another classmate.
