## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

Technical Challenge I faced was to understand the sequence of coding. In my opinion, this lab was little bit longer than other labs we worked. Therefore, it was complicated to follow the instruction such as printing out the code and changing the DNA into different version. We have to make a change in the same DNA every section which confused me to use different coding. I thought we should make a change in the last version of DNA, so I was coding in the last product of DNA and it was showing error. Then, I went to TA's office hours and figured out the problem. It was great experience to challenge myself and learn the manipulation.
