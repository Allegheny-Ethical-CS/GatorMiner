## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).
for the first string i used dna2 i was telling the program that i was using the DNA as a variable.

the random method i used was tell the program that rand was my variable for random
the random used was to get a random letter chosen in the DNA string.
- `nextInt`: consetetur sadipscing elitr
- `String dna2 = ""` i Used this to show that the dna2 variable needs to replace the letters in the dna String
- `random rand` i used random because i needed to pick a random positions in the dna string to insert a new dna letter
