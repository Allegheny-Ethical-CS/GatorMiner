## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
random package, there are so many fun things could be done with this. and most of reecent are focusing on the game
of string literature, such as changing a letter at some place. It is fun at first but not so with time goes on.
I am looking forward to some poroblem even involing some challenging math to be more interesting.
