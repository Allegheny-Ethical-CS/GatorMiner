## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
when doing the converting staff, learning that the comuptational strategy is a big part of the programming
editting. some simple logical difference will result in a huge difference in the output. so it is always
worthy to think all the things through before starting writing the program.And still, I do not know using
docker run or gradle run at the upper directory is the most convenient way to compile or run. since I am
using vim editor, I feel using javac and java command to compile and run at the code directory is the best
way for me.
