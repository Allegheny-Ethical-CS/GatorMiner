## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
computer scientist, biochemists, bioethicists are all needed to make genome editing technology.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Currently its mostly researchers and the agriculture industry as the technology has not been widely ethically tested for medical uses. Some point soon, Parents can use gnome editing to alter cancer related genes in their future children.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Everyone who has not been approved by an ethics committee. As most ethicists agree we don't have enough information on how genome editing affects humans. Human testing does not get approved by ethics committees. Any anyone underqualified should stay out of labs.
4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
Because genome editing happens in embryos it only happens to those who cannot consent. Or if for some reason a researcher does go on and decide to try gene editing to prevent HIV with out approval, there is no way of knowing how those kids will grow up. Will the editing have any unintended consequences?

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
The ethics committees have been mostly effective. Journals can refuse to publish work for papers that do not meet the ethical criteria. Grants could be reserved until an ethics committee shows approval.
