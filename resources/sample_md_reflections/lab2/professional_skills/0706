## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

One learning experience that I have valued the most is being able to acquire knowledge in new languages such as code. I consider this computer science class to be a logic and language class more so than a coding class since it is something that has its own definitions and words and also its own ways of thinking. I am very grateful to getting better at understanding that because it expands my literacy overall.
