## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

I learned that I have different resources available to me when I am working on a program while in class. There are the technical leaders, the teacher, my peers and even online help. I leaned that I should properly use all the resources that are available for me so that I can be as optimal as I can be when making programs such as these.
