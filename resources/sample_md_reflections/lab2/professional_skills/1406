## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
One thing that I learned from completing this assignment is patience and just trying things, even if you think they won't work. One thing that gives me confidence to do coding is the ability to try things based off of work that I've done previously. After I've tried different methods and nothing works, that's usually when I ask for help. I do value the ability to go back and check on my other work to assist me when it comes to new projects I'm doing. It's something that helps me to continue to improve my ability to code and learn new ways to utilize the code.
