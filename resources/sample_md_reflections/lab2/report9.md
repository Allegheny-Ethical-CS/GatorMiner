## Data

The data we decided to use in our project came from the popular t.v. series Game of Thrones. We got this data from the website https://www.tv-subs.net/, where were able to obtain the subtitles of a show in the form of an .srt file.

## Text Generation

We used textgen to create the synopsis based on the text from the Game of Thrones episode, Rains of Castamere.

## Text Analysis
We used textgen to train the model and generate a text from the synopsis it came up with. Then we used the VADER senitment analyzer to score these texts for their sentiment. We were already familiar with VADER because one of our team members references them in their comp.

## Supplemental Production

Our synopsis mentions war and and a sword several times, and this theme kept coming back even when we ran the program multiple times, to generate different kinds of text. Are plan was to 3D print a broken sword using the 3D printer, yet since none of us had access to one at home we were unable. Here is a link to the sword we planned to show along with our project, https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1933150.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

The synopsis we created was minimum, and the program would need more training data to create a better synopsis. While I can understand the dialogue, it isn't fully coherent. This may be due to that particular episode we chose as well.
During this lab one of the clear challenges was our communication during this lab session. We are very close friends so it was easy to ask hey when do you want to work on this and so on. But it was very difficult to communicate since we were not sitting next to each other it was hard to make sure we were working on separate things and weren't just doing the same thing and repeating it. With communication being an issue another issue we had was working around the hectic time we are currently in. With all the breaks and extensions it was difficult to keep track of everything that was going on and when deadlines were due and making sure we did our work on time.

## Ethical Benefits and Implications

The future technology this could be used for is allowing writers to create their own spinoffs of shows with the same themes. For example if creators are seeing the sci fi movies are a big hit then they can take the scripts of the most popular shows an try to allow a computer to create the next hit show. Another thing this technology could be use for is to directors to create adaptations of the film while not changing the script they could post it online to show how the script could vary if x did y or so on and so forth.

Then, hypothesizing on the issues highlighted in your generated (or modified) text, answer the following questions.

1. What future technology is featured in your synopsis?
The future technology featured is the ability to use scripts and create show spinoffs that are just as popular, and also the other benefit is that it will allow fanatics of the shows to have an alternate ending without costing the film maker extra money with paying the camera crews and everything else.

2. What are the potential social implications and/or ethical issues and/or regulatory challenges with this technology?

A potential implication is that directors could use this to make extra money off other shows such as spinoffs or alternate endings without having to pay the extra workers since it will all be computer automated. It will create a big fight between the workers and directors sine they will make money off of more shows, but the people who put effort in will not get paid.

3. What do you think might be a cautionary tale related to this technology?

I think a cautionary tale could be that everyone should be able to make money off of all the extra stuff that is produced because they were all in the process of making the film and thats why it got so popular and was allowed to make spinoffs and alternate endings.

4. What fictional person in the future could best illustrate this caution?

A fictional person in the future could be a director or a person who is in charge of paying people to be in the films. Or the other person could be creating a position that makes sure everyone gets money evenly and no one is scamming other people. This person could make sure everything is sorted out evenly before hands a create a contract people can sign and agree to beforehand.

5. What is their story?

Their story is that they strive on making sure everything is equal because they genuinely care about making sure people are happy and accompanied for for the work they do. They love making sure people are happy and feeling the best they can.

6. Now, consider what a ```Light Mirror``` scenario would be for this story. That is, what benefit can come out of the  technology featured in the story and how can we work towards preventing the negative consequences of the future they envision?

A benefit that could come out of this technology is the ability for fans of a certain show to be able to go more in depth with the show and allow for alternate endings to be shown without having to go into production cost of creating a script. Meanwhile a negative consequence is that people will have to be provided for because they were apart of the show and thats why spinoffs or alternate endings that made it so great.
