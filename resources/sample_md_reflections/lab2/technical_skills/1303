## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
The greatest technical challenge that i faced was probably figuring out how to get a random position in the DNA string to a random letter it took me a while to under stand how to do it. one I used the charAt I and used rand I got it to work. this challenge took me a lot of time to figure out and with a little bit of help from one of the technical leaders i was able to figure it out.
