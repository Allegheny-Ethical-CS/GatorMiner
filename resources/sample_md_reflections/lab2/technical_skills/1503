## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
The greatest challenge to me was the fact of knowing what I am doing. I feel like the class is going so fast. I have not had any technology experience prior to this class and to be honest I am a little overwhelmed with everything. It looks like a different language to me and I feel like I am starting to get lost. I still need help on overcoming it, but we will get there.
