## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I want to practice more reading the gradle grade commands that it gives us when something goes wrong. When it gives me a list of stuff that is wrong with the program I am lost at to what those mean. The hardest part for me is knowing what it means and how to fix it. Mainly just the comprehension part of the gradle grade is what I need more help on. Also I also find it hard to understand if i need a system, int, or what in front of what i am about to do for a strig. I am good when it comes to a line but when it comes to what to put on the next string of commands that is when i get confused as well. Mainly I need help with my problem solving skills with computers.
