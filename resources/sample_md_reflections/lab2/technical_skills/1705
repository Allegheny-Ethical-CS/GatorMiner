## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I want to practice more using the random and replace method and also using the string to randomly choose a position to replace with another letter. Finish these tasks was difficult. Sometimes you wrote it right. However, when you gradle run your program. the outcome was not quite match to what you expect. and especially when you set a range. It is difficult to remember where the number you set is inclusive or exclusive. I believe in the later class if we practice more, we will get more familiar with this. And will not be headache when we see this similar questions again.
