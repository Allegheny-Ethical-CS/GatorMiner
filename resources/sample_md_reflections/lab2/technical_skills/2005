## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?

After completing this lab assignment, one task that I want to practice more is the randomization tool. I just feel as if I am not as good as I should be when using that type of code. I feel like I always have to look back in my class documents or the professor’s slides in order to know how to use it properly. It is a relatively easy tool to use but I just can’t wrap my head around it and I think I just need some more practice.
