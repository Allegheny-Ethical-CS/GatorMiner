## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

One learning experience I valued the most after this lab is using a “for loop”. I have little to no experience when it comes to using for loops in my code and we just recently learned how to and when to use them and so it was very cool getting the chance to use it and implement it myself.
