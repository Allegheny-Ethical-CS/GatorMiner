## Challenges and Learning Experiences

As I mentioned above before generating the text I trained the model in Google
Colab notebook, and then saved it to the drive, First I wanted
to try text generation in Goolge Colab, but it would fail all the time, so I
downloaded the trained model and then generated the text locally. That seemed
to work, but I am still not sure why it wasn't generating in the notebook,
using almost same steps. I suspect that it had something to do with loading
the file form Google drive.
I also had a challenge when trying to color the tokens based on the POS. So
as I mentioned above the `pos_tag()` function tags the tokens and returns as a
list of tuple. So I decided to iterate though the tuples and with
conditional logic find tokens with same POS and color them, and return as
a list. But I didn't want to have a list of words but colored text. Every
time I would print list items did not have colors. Later after research I
discovered that colors can be applied to `String` only during printing.
So I used `join()` method to return list of word as a text and print them.
That seemed to work.
