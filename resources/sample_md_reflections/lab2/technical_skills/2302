## Text Generation

Reference: https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn
For text generation, I first read in scripts from both Black Mirror and Green Arrow through `utf-8` and `ISO-8859-1` encoding. I then stored combined these two datasets are stored all scripts in `src/GenScript.txt`. The next step I have done is to use `textgen` package's `textgenrnn().train_from_file("src/GenScript.txt")` to train a RNN model where the weights are stored in the `textgenrnn_weights.hdf5` file. I then used the trained weight file as input to text generation function. The sample output for a generation as follows:

Without trained weight:

```
The Internet Bros Thousands Speed As Secret Facebook Transform (Internations)
```

With trained weight:
