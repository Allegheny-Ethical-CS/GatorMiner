## Text Analysis

Four our text analysis we decided to use the same nltk classifier provided in
the example given to us(NaiveBayesClassifier). We added our own training data to
train the classifier for our text data. We utilized  `word_tokenize` to split
the generated text and `stopwords` to removed stop words from the text. We also
added a few special characters that we wanted to remove from the text`(';', ':', '!', "*", "?", "<", "-", "_", ".", "/", ">", ",")`. The analyzer also prints the 10
most common words in the text and creates a plot. The classifier prints if the
text is positive, negative our natural.

Output:

`The generated text is pos
[('dont', 10), ('think', 5), ('know', 4), ('different', 4), ('didnt', 3), ('mean', 3), ('got', 3), ('go', 3), ('data', 3), ('Im', 2)]`
