## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
The people who tend to be responsible for constructing the genome editing technology are the researchers and bioethicists.
2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
The users of the genome editing technology are most commonly scientists and researchers who are collaborating to make changes to the DNA.
3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Editing genome cells should not be allowed by the common/uncertified people and also those who have not obtained legal access to the program.
4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
If not done correctly, distortion's in the DNA could be made which will ultimately affect the human themselves.
5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
The best way to avoid harm in my opinion is to continue carefully continue to do work on the editing programs to assure that there will be no issues or complications. There is no reason that this program should ever be utilized if there isn't absolute certainty of its success because of the catastrophic conclusions mistakes could lead to.
