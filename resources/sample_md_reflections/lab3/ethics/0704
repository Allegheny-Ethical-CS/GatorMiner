## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

Who makes the genome editing technology?

Biologists and researchers, though the technology has been banned in several countries for the time being.

Who are the users of the genome editing technology?

Currently no doctors/therapy methods use genome editing technology for people due to safety concerns. However, the researchers and scientists involved with creating and developing genome editing technology are also those that are technically using that technology.

Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?

People can use genome editing technology as long as it is not used on research or for the purpose of reproduction and live embryos. To avoid the risks that may arise.

How can the genome editing technology cause harm?

There is a risk in using it for therapeutic reasons because there are imprecisions in targeting genes or imprecisions on how those genes may react. Also, there are ethical concerns that may cause harm in the sense of safety of individuals. There is also a public order harm potential that may arise with the development of revolutionary technologies that may provoke instability or uprising of the citizen body.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?

Before a research begins, it could be assigned a delegated group of officials in the government and other offices to make sure that nothing is done too hastily or in a manner that will cause public harm. If a groundbreaking discovery is made, it will be kept secret until it is assessed as safe to present to large crowds of people without it causing chaos.
