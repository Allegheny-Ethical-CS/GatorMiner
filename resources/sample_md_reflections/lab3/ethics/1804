## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?

  Researchers create genome editing technology through their work that is funded by stakeholders.

2.Who are the users of the genome editing technology?

  Parents that both carry homozygous dominant genes for polygenic disorders are prospective users of genome editing, so that their offspring does not have a genetic disorder. There are currently not many users of genome editing because it is not widely accepted in most cultures.

3.Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?

   Users that use genome editing solely for the purpose of enhancing their genome are not supposed to use genome editing. This is due to the ethical issue that arises when only certain social classes have access to genome editing. Anyone that wants to use genome editing to harm another human being or to enhance their personal genes should not be using genome editing.

4.How can the genome editing technology cause harm?

   Genome editing can cause harm because it can create a class of people with elite genes. It also can cause genetic defects if it is not done correctly.

5.What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?

   Regulations that stop people from using genome editing for enhancement can avoid harm to other individuals. For example, in the U.S. the NIH will not fund gene editing in human embryos. There must be advocates that support regulations so that the people that do not have a voice in the debate will not feel the effects of the harm genome editing can cause.
