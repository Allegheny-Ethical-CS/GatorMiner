## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

The one experience i have valued the most is the time I spent struggling on this lab alone. With this experience I have realized that I can not do everything in this class on my own even though up to this point I have without much help. Through realizing this I believe it will help me ask for help, so I can further understand some of the concepts that we have discussed that I have obviously not as much of a grasp on as I thought I did.
