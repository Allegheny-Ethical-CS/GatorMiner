## Design

The overall design of our robot is pretty simple, besides one part. When we were building
our robot we wanted to build something that was relatively fast. In the past we
have worked with these kind of bots and knew that a gear system had to be set up
in order to get an increase in speed. We also used sensors to help the robot detect
the environment that surrounded it. The first sensor that we used was the touch sensor.
We used this sensor in the sprint race and pushing race. The objective for this sensor
was to just get the robot to stop. The other sensor that was used was the ultrasonic
sensor. We used this sensor in the obstacle race. We felt it was crucial to have a sensor
like this to detect objects that the robot was heading towards. Every time the ultrasonic
sensor got a reading, the robot would change its movement patterns and move around
each obstacle encountered. When we were programming our bot for each of our races,
we tried to keep them simple. At first, we tried to program all the sensors. Then after
days of programming and testing with no success, We realized that it needed to be kept simple.
The programs that we created for the races are not complex, but they still do what they
were intended to.

###Aggressive behavior for robot:
When we were first designing our robot, we really were not sure what kind of
aggressive behavior we could add. After testing our programs for the first few times
we started to get some ideas. For our robot specifically, we decided to make our
robot do an aggressive behavior in the sprinting race. When our robot is done racing,
it will spin and do a 360. To us this was an aggressive behavior because the goal
of the sprint race is to just go in a straight line as fast as possible. Nothing else
is suppose to happen after that. All robots are designed to perform and complete a certain task.
When something random happens that wasn't accounted for, the behavior of the machine
or robot will certainly change. The change may be very small, but it could be the
cause to a bigger problem.

###Summary and Outcome of race:
After reading the article we can say that robots can be ethical but to a certain
degree. If robots are designed incorrectly than they can pose a threat to everyone
around them. People can use them for exploitation or even worse harm. In the article
the author discusses how even creating ethical robots in the first place could
be unethical. Ethical robots can be a good improvement for society but they have
to be designed in a way that allows them to only perform the tasks that they
were intended to do. In the long run, it depends on the public's opinion if a specific
robot is ethical or not. After looking at the races, we noticed that one of the aggressive
behaviors was in the pushing race. The robot backed up after pushing the box and started going
back forth hitting the box over and over again. One ethical behavior we saw was how the
robots reached the finish line at a really fast rate.
