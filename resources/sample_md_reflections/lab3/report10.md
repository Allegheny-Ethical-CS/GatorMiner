## Design

Our robot was designed for speed from the get-go. The motors are placed on the
bot to place more weight on the drive wheels and give us more traction so we
can spin them faster. The two motors are also connected to the same single-axle
design so we can apply more power to the gear chain which allowed us to make
the chain a bit longer. Finally, we used a single wheel in front attached
to a medium motor which allowed us to turn without having to use separate
wheel motors. The programs therefore were actually less complicated when
dealing with starting or stopping the bot, as the single axel design accounted
for the common problem of the motors not starting and stopping at the same time.
All the programs were similar however, since we had little time left after
finishing the build of the bot.

Each race basically consists of us moving in a straight line, with the first
one using an ultrasonic sensor to stop. We considered this to be our ethical
behavior since the sensor will terminate the program before any collision
occurs (hopefully) and the robot does not have any other features or attachments
that might interfere with other robots. The second race has our robot stop with
a button press, which we took as ethical as once again we do not attempt to
interfere with other robots while we are attempting to push to box. We also had
an attachment that attempted to hold the box in front of us but didn't
interfere with any other bots. The final program was actually a duplicate of
the second one, but we had a large pusher attachment that was designed to allow
us to push the obstacles out of the way and complete the course as fast as
possible to hopefully account for the time penalty. We considered this bot
agressive as it ignores the rules of the race to complete it at any means
necessary.

As a summary of the article. Ethical robots are vulnerable to many types
of unethical situations, including misuse and hacking. To combat this,
robots should not be programmed to be ethical explicitly but instead
be implicity ethical according to moor's laws. According to the article,
many of the robots are not explicity ethical, but rather attempt to
accomplish their task regardless of ethics. This leads almost all the
bots to be implicitly ethical during the sprint race, as none of them
actively attempted to interfere in the race. This holds for all of our
own robots programs as well, as we do not attempt to undermine other
robots for our own gain.
