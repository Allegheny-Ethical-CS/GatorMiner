## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I think, as I say after almost every lab at this point, is that the labs have less and less original code already done for us so we have to contribute more and more to each project. The more I have to do on my own makes me learn the 'coding language' better and helps me understand what I am doing when coding (before I check by gradle running). After this lab I feel better about declaring variable and working with such variable to edit them the way my program requires. However, like I said before, I still want to practice it more because I still feel uncomfortable when creating programs with many variables.
