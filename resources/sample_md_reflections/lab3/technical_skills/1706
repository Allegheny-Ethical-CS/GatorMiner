## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I found out that, sometimes even though you wrote it correctly in your Atoms, but in the terminal the outcome was slightly different to the requiement of the questions. You will need to clearly see the output of your program and count the letters if the program really delete or add one letter to the DNA string. your outcome sometimes delete two letter or adding two more letter instead of one, which does not accomplish the requirements. So it is really important to see the out when you runs your program, even sometimes it sucessfully ran it. This not only provide the accuracy for the programmer but also trains a programmer to be more careful when doing other computer science assignments.
