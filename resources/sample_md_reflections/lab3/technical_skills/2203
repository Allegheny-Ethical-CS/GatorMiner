## Text Analysis
Describe the techniques used for an automated text analysis of your automated script synopsis. Cite (provide a link to) any sources you have used. Include a graph or textual output of your analysis.

As I am working alone rather than in a team for this assignment I figured the easiest thing to do for analysis would be word frequency. I considered sentiment analysis but that would require some kind of data to model after and I wasn't sure how appropriate using a model trained on positive and negative twitter posts would be for this application. I took the output file from the text generation and tokenized it and used NLTK's FreqDist plot to display the data below.
