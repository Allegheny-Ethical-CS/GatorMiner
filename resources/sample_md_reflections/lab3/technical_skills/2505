## Challenges and Learning Experiences

Discuss any challenges you have encountered during the work on this lab and  describe what have you learned.
While working on this lab we encountered many different challenges, however we were able to overcome them. One of the main challenges we faced was finding a way to randomly generate a synopsis from our input data. We struggled with this because it was very difficult for us to generate a synopsis that actually created sentences that were comprehendible. After reviewing our options we were able to overcome this challenge by using the GPT-2 model to generate a synopsis from our input data.
