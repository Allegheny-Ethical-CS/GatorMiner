# Document Requirements

GatorMiner is using markdown format for the student reflection documents. Its organized structure allows us to parse and perform text analysis easily. With that being said, there are a few requirements for the reflection document before it could be seamlessly processed and analyzed with GatorMiner. A [template](https://github.com/Allegheny-Ethical-CS/GatorMiner/blob/master/resources/reflection_template.md) is provided below. It is important to note the headers with the assignment's and student's ID/name are required. GatorMiner is set in default to take the first header as assignment name and the second header as student name.

You can also check out the [sample json report](https://github.com/Allegheny-Ethical-CS/GatorMiner/blob/master/resources/sample_json_report/report%201.json) to see the format of json reports GatorMiner gathers from AWS.

Once the documents are correctly upload, select the assignments that you want to compare.
