# Summary

# What is it?

Summary provides a chart containing all of the information pulled from the uploaded documents. This information includes the assignment title, the author of the reflection, and the answers to all of the questions asked in all of the documents. Therefore, if a question was asked in assignment A, but not in assignment B, the table will be blank in the assignment B column under the row that asks the question given in assignment A.

Within the GatorMiner tool, you have the ability to choose `Summary` as an analysis option after the path to the desired reflection documents is submitted.

# How to use it?

When `Summary`, the program automatically creates a table with all of the information. There are no other options for this analysis selection.
